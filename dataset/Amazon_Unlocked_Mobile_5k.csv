272322,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Red,Nokia,Yep what works - I really like. What will not work -1. Cannot send pictures with sms - ISP says it's the phone - which looking at the reviews seems to be a common problem.2. Have tried to hook up the Nokia suite but it will not connect under any conditions - which is one of the main reasons I switched back to Nokia.3. Does have a nice display4. Will not stay shut off when charging - Will always come back on.5. Have found customer support to be next to none - see # 16. For some reason I cannot put some dates into next year. Will add them and then they just disappear.7. The calendar does not allow duplication by day of the month (ex. third Wednesday)8. Adobe - not all of their programs work with this model.9. Does a good job with email10. Bluetooth works well with our home phone system11. The feedback to Nokia has never worked - and it has always been turned on.12. Battery life has been good - but I do put it on the charger every night.13. Apparently AT&T does not offer 4G - so I was not able to take advantage of it - or the phone will not recognize it.14. Got a Trident case and it fits better than a glove.FYI - my friend had a 1120 and returned it 3 times for replacement before he got a different brand. Same problem on the sending photos with sms. Yes we are both on AT&T but different ISP.,3,1

393989,"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,"Yeah, literally had 10 minutes of use before the back panel broke. Had a case on it, but the phone is does not have enough structural support and flexes too much. Knew I should have gotten the z5 compact, but took a chance on this just because of the magnetic charging so I wouldn't have to worry about the usb connector giving out.UPDATE 7/24/26So I've had this a few weeks now, I have to lower my rating, wish I could give it 0 stars. lollipop killed the battery life so I went back-to-back kitkat and that solved that. the big problem is the microphone doesnt work correctly unless you take a call on speaker. This is a software issue but I've tried all the ""fixes"" suggested on the Web and none have worked. I understand why Sony never had any success in the US mobile market, this phone is plagued with so many issues.",1,1
161432,"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GOLD",BLU,"YAY! Finally, BLU releases a premium Android smartphone with hardware --rather than software-- navigation buttons/controls and then designs the navigation controls for left-handed users (i.e., exception rather than the rule)! Why not use an industry-accepted ""BACK"" button positioning on the left and the ""RECENTS"" button on the right... especially when they can't be swapped? Unless you're left-handed, an elf, or a smidget (no offense intended), having the BACK button on the right-hand side of even the largest phones on the market creates thumb cramping and contributes to carpel tunnel. Logistically, it's the equivalent of Google, Mozilla, Microsoft or Apple placing the BACK button in their browsers on the right side of the FORWARD button, doesn't make sense! Great phone specs and overall quality, but an obvious oversight by BLU (and other cell phone manufacturers). =/UPDATE: I have no problem upgrading my review based on the quality of this phone. Maybe my ""weighting"" of the navigation button placement vs. the overall benefit of hardware navigation was a little too ""right-handed"". I may still purchase this phone based on the hardware navigation alone, but in defense of my critique, the 'navigation button placement' isn't BLU's first (seemingly-obvious) oversight when it comes to design. Anyone who's owned multiple BLU phones like me understands the frustration of having to route their micro-USB charging cable up, around, and into the charging port at the top (rather than bottom) of their phone when docked to a dashboard vent mount (even though charging cords always extend from AC/cigarette lighter adapters BELOW the phone). This placement is equally illogical/annoying when trying to use a phone while it's being charged. 😟",4,17
196546,HTC One VX Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Gray/Red,HTC,"Ya know, for the price this is one sweet phone. I mean, if you're the kind of person who is obsessed with the latest greatest uber-tech, you're not gonna be satisfied with something that isn't riding the bleeding edge. But I got this for my kid, because I'd gone the cheapo route last time we had an upgrade with AT&T, and those freebie phones were just not cutting it, they were barely even functional anymore...and then just when we were anticipating an upgrade for them in December, and I'd promised them that, AT&T went and changed our upgrade cycle to 24 months, making us wait until MAY to get new phones. I wasn't gonna let AT&T make a liar out of me, so I came to Amazon in search of something that will hold them over....well, I'm not even sure I'm going to upgrade in May now, because I might let the lines go off-contract and look for a better provider. My son loves this phone, granted it's only been a few weeks and sometimes problems show up later, but so far so good.Stuff I really like:Memory is upgradeable via SD Card.I was concerned we might have to order a mini-Sim since my boy had the oldschool bigger chip, but went to the AT&T store and they used a thing that looked like a stapler to punch his SIM to the smaller size, quick easy and free fix.The color is nice.So far performance seems great.Price was reasonable.Other stuff worth mentioning: You get 3 screens to put your desktop shortcuts for apps on. Some phones have more. 3 is enough for us, but your mileage may vary.",5,8

Although the phone has ""fixed"" itself now it was very very annoying for a while. First I could not receive calls then people could not dial my number, then people had to dial my number plus area code. Second every text I received was duplicated, triplicated or multiplied up to 10 times! As in I would receive the same text multiple times. I called my carrier and wondered if I was being charged, i was not charged so the phone was just buggin alot. They said it was getting used to the ""network"" it took 4 weeks for it to get used to the network. I hope this doesnt happen to anyone. Other than those problems the phone is fantastic, solid build, great camera, awesome UI.",2,1
262273,Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,"Wow, Nokia finally hit it right. This is a great phone although it dosen't have the modern G4 speeds. That's a best kept secret. It makes for longer battery life because it isn't always searching for the high speed port. The WIFI is smple and easy to get up and going. I have fairly large fingers and the qwerty keyboard is not that hard to maneuver. Texting is now much simpler as is email and messaging.Best of all it is very user friendly and easy to get what you want out of it. Nokia backs it pretty well with lots of free apps and games. I will finally retire my RAZR for this one.This is the one if you have previously given up on battery life and basic functionality.",5,2

Do not trust BLU Products!!!When you file a warranty claim they make you pay to ship the phone to them and their standard turn around time is 20 days. I managed to get a 24 hour turn around time though because I caused a big stink about the inconvenience.

355549,"Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900A GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Blue",samsung,"Worst Online experience so far.I thought I did an extensive research before my purchase. I guess I didnt. I have had my phone for 6 months only and I regret this purchase.For starters it comes with several at&t apps and widgets that took me a while to know how to uninstall and disable, and they used my battery and my data. (I guess that's just ignorance from my side)Then with a silly fall the screen cracked pretty bad, and replacing it was expensive.The charger got damaged pretty fast, I was surprised by this. It was supposed to be original right?The battery also got damaged and became unusable. I was told this should not happen with this thpe of phone so fast, meaning one thing. The battery was not original. They check my charger and guess what. It was not originall either. The outlet piece should handle 5.3V and it just handles 5.0v which apparently makes a big difference and could have been another reason why the fake battery got ruined fast.Anyways, after this experience I am not buying from this seller and I would probably buy to a company which gives a better warranty (more than a month) if I make an online purchase.",1,2

It shows only 4G on the phone, but that's okay for me. So far this phone has been reliable, battery life good for 2 days most of the time and most important, it doesn't overheat when using gps and charging!.....I couldn't use my 920 because the battery was always draining or overheating. This is apparent to be trouble with all nokia/lumina built in battery high end phones. Very disappointed to spend 500 bux on a phone and battery charge circuit/battery being faulty. For that price, it is expected to work!I bought a 520, 521, 635 and now the 640xl . They all use replaceable batteries and have no battery overheat issues while charging or when using GPS. The 920 overheated and shut down when I needed it most for GPS on a 14hr drive.I have iPhone 4, 5, 5s, 6 and 6plus. Though those phones are nice, its 900 plus for the 6plus with 64gb.. This phone is 300 with a 128gb card.Okay, I don't have as many apps available, but I don't need it all. Only bad, BAD thing....The drive Maps can not be stored in micro sd card and there is only 8gb of memory in the phone.

It is not quick to change any camera setting, so I usually end up using Auto mode most of the time to avoid missing out on quick shots.Battery life is not the longest, so I have to recharge every night. I listen to audiobooks without head phones and use the camera and checking emails. If you use the camera a lot you might not even make it through the day without charging. The extra battery in the camera grip is handy for that, but then you have no protective casing available anymore!So overall I love my phone and am happy with it.

243629,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,"With price factored in, this has to be a 5 star phone. The specs are good, the phone is plastic, but feels very sturdy. The battery lasts all day. Lenovo continued motorola's theme of a bare Android O.S., so there is NO bloatware whatsoever on this phone. All apps are google, including the keyboard, phone and messaging app. Screen is large and crystal clear. I was actually debating removing a start because of a really annoying design flaw of this phone. The back is removable for easy access to sim and micro SD card slot. You'd think, if you were smart, that you would make the battery removable, if you are making the back removable, but no, they failed horribly at this reasoning. I have no idea why the made the battery built in. In any event, for $299.00 for 64gb storage, 4gb memory, expandable storage, and a pure Google OS with no contract and fully unlocked on ALL CARRIERS, i had to give it 5 stars anyways, though 4.5 is probably more accurate in my opinion. The fingerprint scanner is actually better than my Note 5. It is faster, and unlocks your screen instantly without having to press any buttons from screen off. More and more apps are integrating logins with the phones finger print scanner, so I imagine this feature will only become more and more useful as time goes on. This phone is 70% cheaper than say a Galaxy note 7 that catches fire, or an iPhone 7. I'm very please with this phone at this price level, and to not be tied down in a verizon contract is really very satisfying.Any gamers out there wonder how the phone handles games, i can't really help you there. I do play Clash Royale without any issues, though I'm not sure how demanding that game is. If you're looking for a decent smart phone, at a lower price point, i'm sure the Moto g4 play , or Moto g4 is also a good choice.",5,2
265606,Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black),Nokia,"With one word: NO.After owning and E71 for over a year, which for me was by far the best phone that I have ever used, I was really excited about getting the new E72 since it featured a 600Mhz CPU which seemed to be my main and only issue with the E71. However the CPU was the only upgrade in this unit and almost everything else seemed to be in fact a downgrade. As mentioned by another reviewer this phone has serious stability issues. The FP2 OS is extremely buggy and crashes, reboots and freezes several times a day. Nokia really needs to work on a new firmware to correct this. Below is every quality of the phone that I could think of as compared to the E71.HARDWARE-----------------------------BUILD QUALITY: Definitely not as solid of a feeling compared to the mostly metal E71. The D-pad feels like cheap plastic and it has some free play. The back cover tends to move occasionally when you are holding the phone to your ear.SPEAKERPHONE: Very poor quality compared to the E71. There is very noticeable buzzing near the maximum volume, even with high quality music files. Calls on speakerphone at max volume are plain annoying due to the buzzing. On top of that the speaker is not as loud as the one on the E71.CALL QUALITY: Excellent call quality except at the maximum volume where the call speaker also becomes distorted.KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard feels slightly better than the one on the E71. The buttons seem to give out somewhat of a better feedback. However the E72 is slightly wider than the E71 which makes it a little harder to type on with one hand. The new track pad navigation provides a very inconsistent performance and it is not even close to the one on the newer blackberries. Scrolling up and down is perfectly fine but scrolling sideways becomes an exercise. The good news is that the original directional pad like on the E71 is still there so you can just disable the touchpad if you hate it just as much as I did after a week of usage.CAMERA: It is still a cell phone camera so keep your expectations low. It takes decent pictures and the quality is about the same as the E71 but with 5 megapixel images and slightly wider lens. The camera application now has built-in panorama mode. Video at 640x480 is plain horrible. The flash on this phone is actually pretty decent. One thing that was very annoying to me is that it uses a very bright focus light(AKA The flash) which makes focusing at macro impossible if you are trying to take a picture of something with brighter colors that reflect more light. There is no way to disable the focus light either, not even in macro mode. Nokia should think about this as well.BATTERY LIFE: There is simply nothing like it. Except the E71. The battery life on the E72 is also exceptional. I am able to get 2 to 3 days of very heavy usage on it, including 2 to 3 hours of talking, 2 hours of browsing and some text messaging. I have not seen any other phone in this category which gets even close to these stats.GPS: Works great and it gets a position fix generally within 5 seconds. It seems a little faster than the E71. The E72 also has a compass.SOFTWARE-------------------------This is the bad part.FP2: Aside from unifying various internet connections I really did not see much if any of an improvement in this version of the Symbian OS. In fact it features some ugly menu transitions and it has a lot of stability issues. You would get out of memory error with a subsequent freezing at least a couple of times in a day and reboots and total freezes which require battery removal are not uncommon either.APPLICATION UNLOCK: Yes, the phone is hackable with HelloOX 2 and up.WEB BROWSER: The browser is definitely improved from the E71 afar as rendering and navigation goes. However I was never able to complete even ONE single browsing session without this thing crashing and just exiting in the middle of something. It would have been great if it did not crash.E-MAIL: About as bad as the client available on my first T-Mobile Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 2002. Although that one was a little better than what Nokia has provided. It is almost 2010 and Nokia still does not have an e-mail client which supports in-line HTML. The Nokia messaging software and service is plain horrible. After 3 days of usage I just cancelled my account and went to using webmail. It is really that bad and this is unacceptable for a supposed ""business"" device. As an alternative, I would recommend Emoze. Their software even partially supports in-line HTML. If you have Hotmail, you can download Windows Live for Symbian. It works really well.PODCASTING & INTERNET RADIO: Missing!!!???! Very disappointing.SIP CLIENT: Missing!!! The SIP settings are there, but there is no client. So forget about gizmo or any similar service unless you are using a third party client like Nimbuzz or Fring.OFFICE APPLICATIONS: This is one positive category. Quickoffice features a free upgrade to open and edit Office 2007 documents. Nokia has also added Wpresenter, Multiscanner and Font Magnifier as standard applications.--------------------Overall the E72 is a mixed bag for me. It delivers on speed and the browser is well improved but the stability issues, missing software and some other quirks make this device seem like a downgrade. If I was aware of these issues it is likely that I would have stayed with the E71. So if you are in doubt, my advice would be save your money or at least wait for a firmware update which fixes the stability issues. I hope this was helpful.",2,146

After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund..

254402,"Motorola Moto X Developer GSM Edition Factory Unlocked Phone, 32GB, Black/Woven White",Moto X,"Where to start; the device is exceeding the whole list of requirements, and is good for other aspects; great value for 290 dollars (absolutely not a good value for 799); these are my considerations.To begin with; I have been using an iPhone 5S for a while, and I've always purchased iPhone, but lately I felt like I don't really want to be tied to a carrier, and have a 2 year agreement to have the iPhone, so I decided to go for an unlocked device that is a good value for what it offers. The Samsung and the iPhone are great devices but the 800 dollars pricetag is out of this world in my opinion...I don't buy a device that cost more than 300 dollars, because it is a moral obligation to not pay such prices for a phone; because in the end that's what they are (personal opinion, moving on).This device is fast, the generous amount of memory make it responsive to app swapping and scrolling. The main processor is not that strong, but the X uses a combination of chipset, which include a dedicated 3d chip and another couple that take care of notifications and backend services. This result in blazing fast performances, even if technically the phone is inferior on the paper to many other devices.The memory is not upgradeable, but 32 gb are plenty; especially if you don't put hundreds of apps that you never use, or movies and videos that you rarely watch. Speed is good enough nowadays to use streaming, so you can use cloud services and save space on your device, for the data that you really need (depends if you have it as toy or as phone/work item; that would dictate how you use it I believe).The look is gorgeous, slightly curved and fit perfectly in my hands (I have average hands for a 6 feet man); the screen is OLED, so the same as you can see on a PS Vita and other modern devices. It is nice and bright; incredibly crisp, even if the pixel distribution and the resolution are not the same as a retina. I've been using Retina display and iPhones for years, and I can't really see the difference on the Moto X, even when reading documents or internet pages. I wear glasses, so to me the screen quality is essential, and this device fits me perfectly.The button location is a bit strange, since the power is on the right, above the volume rocker, but it is not a big deal Then you will find the micro usb connector on the bottom and the headphone jack on the top (talking about top and bottom, when you have a rotating screen, has little meaning IMO).The speakers are good (one single speaker in the back of the device); music and movie play well on it, but you may want to use headphones. The camera is really good quality; altho the software is not allowing you to control easily the focus point, and in low light conditions is easy to loose track of the focus, so you end up aiming at something and having on focus something that is much closer, because the camera software change at the last moment.To take pictures you tap on the screen; this is counter intuitive if you are used to an iPhone, where you tap to set focus and ""aperture"" (there is no such thing, but I can't find a better analogy); I can't understand yet how do you decide what has to be locked in focus with the camera software, but I believe it is a matter of practice. The results are great outdoor, in good light condition and with static subjects; I tried to take photos of moving subjects like people, and the results are good, if you do not have too many objects on different planes, so the sensor does not get confused.The camera has the flash led, not necessary but super necessary in most cases (included when you need a flashlight :) ), it shine brightly but the range seems inferior to the one on the iPhone 5S.You can launch the camera when the phone is locked, jsut doing a quick double wrist rotation. Gimmicky but works fine when you don't want to unlock the phone.2 nice features added to this device are the interactive notification system, and the vocal commands.The notfication system is less intrusive, and since the OLED display uses only the pixels that it turns on, you don't waste battery life.Basically the screen will show you an icon when you get a notification, and you may decide to slide up and go to the app that notified you, or slide down to just unlock. The notification will continue to appear at intervals (not flashing, the notification fade in and out very discreetly), unless you slide the cursor tapping on the screen and dragging the finger on the side of the device. You can still have regular notifications with audio and vibration, it is up to you. I like this because it is discreet and elegant.The second is the voice recognition; where you just say ""hey google now"", and the device listen to your commands. So far it gets all that I say, and English is not my first language. Siri user will not notice much of a difference; the service seems to use the same procedure, where it will go online and elaborate your request, then return the results on your phone. It won't accept complex command in sequence, like if you need to find a store and find if the store is open; because the previous command results is not concatenated to the next one. This means that you need to ask for a store near you, and then ask if that store near you is open. Not a deal breaker, since Siri does not do that either, but would be nice to have a system that you can actually talk to, freely, without use your hands (super useful if you have your hands dirty or working; vocal commands are a great alternative).Some people love games: this one run games. I am a benchmark fan, so I downloaded 3dmark and few others; and beside the galaxy note 4 and few others, the performances were above all the other devices that has a higher price tag. I play some games and the graphic is smooth and crisp; keep in mind thou that the battery life will go down drastically. The back of the unit seems to heat up more when you do processing work, with games it stay moderately cool.The battery is the main problem for me so far: it won't last the same as my iPhone 5S. I keep it mainly in my pocket or on my desk; I receive and make phone calls (probably few calls, 10-20 minutes in total per day), play occasionally a game while waiting in line and mostly I check email and use the web. I can go on for a day, but then the phone just can't go on anymore. The iPhone would be charged every 2-3 days, so to me this is a big drop in battery life. I am not sure if I have problems because of the battery, because I do not know Android very well, or I am setting something incorrectly. Just a heads up to give you an idea.The unit is unlocked; uses a micro sim card and the only issue is the trapdoor used to insert the sim: it has a very flimsy lock, and feels like the card may escape at any time. Takes no effort to open it with the included tool; probably this is due the fact that the tray is made of plastic, while on the iPhone, it is in metal, so it gives more resistance and overall it is more solid. I do not feel totally comfortable moving the phone around, but it may be just my feeling (hope that nobody lost their sim card with this phone).You can use any network supported (I believe anything but CDMA, works in EU for sure, with GSM 900/1800; I did not try data traffic outside USA yet, but it should be of use to you anywhere you go (double check the network available when you travel).The developer edition is also different, since you are not forced to use the Motorola build of Android (which is excellent; not much has been added, is very vanilla); if you want, you may request an unlock code for the bootloader, and you will be able to write new OS images on the device (Android is supported, not sure if it may run anything else). This is not for the average user; if you are interested in developing on Android OS, then this device is perfect for you, but if you just want to use the device, you can leave it as is, not unlock the bootloader and you won't loose anything.I did not shop around to see if there is a non developer edition, since this is what I was looking for; if there is a model that cost less, because is not the developer edition, and you are not interested in developing, you may want to look for that.Accessories included are a charger, a micro usb cable and a useful sim tray tool, so you avoid to use a paperclip. This device is not coming with headphones, which is OK. You can use any device that support Android via bluetooth (headphones or earbud, with or without microphone), or regular headsets with the standard 3.5 inch jack (I have a pair of universal Bose with mic, they work fine).Overall is a 5 star, for the price of 300 dollars (you may find it for less; this is the 32 Gb version, the biggest that they make, I believe), great for people that work with the phone, great for the average user, great for gamers (I won't give this to under 18; check the Moto G for kids friendly devices), but absolutely awesome for developers.Ditch the next iPhone, and save yourself 600 dollars; unless you are forced with iOS (which is superior to Android, IMO), otherwise this phone does everything in the same way, and you are also able to develop on it and learn something that can be sold.",5,27

253357,Motorola Moto X (2nd Generation) - Black Leather - 16 GB (U.S. Warranty) Unlocked Phone,Motorola,"Week two of my Moto X. Thankfully I was delivered the XT1095 model. This happened to be a big issue for me as I'm using it in South Africa and this page/seller had no real conclusive information that the XT1095 'Pure Edition' was available.To help any other foreign potential buyers out the XT1095 is truly a 'global phone'. I can't vouch for the Unlocked AT&T version but this XT1095 version works perfectly abroad. The only issue I'm experiencing is that it isn't picking up 4G on the CellC network however this may be due to a coverage issue and not missing band problem. Apart from that the HSDPA+ works perfectly with strong signal.The device itself is built great with the metal band and (in my case) bamboo back giving it an air of quality few can match at the price. Regarding the numerous reviews targeting the brittle screen which was a big concern of mine, I have no screen protector (I do have a case) and am pleased to report zero issues thus far with scratches or cracks. I look after it but don't feel I treat it any differently from my old phone. Its still early days with the phone but so far I am pleased with the durability of the gorgeous AMOLED screen.I haven't had a chance to truly test the camera but did notice the rather simple UI for the camera app. The few pictures I've taken were adequate in low light. However in well lit scenes it shines, matching higher priced rivals. The performance of the phone is smooth and without issue. It may not have the latest and greatest hardware but running the pure Andriod experience it moves swiftly. This in conjunction with the motion sensors that light up your display, showing notifications when reaching for your phone really made me look at phones differently. Features like this that are usually gimmicks on other brands end up being so useful with this Moto X that you really miss them when using a friends phone. It's not the hardware that defines the phone exclusively, it's how it all comes together and this Moto X (2nd Gen) has excelled in that regard.My only issue would be the battery life. Charges last a full day with wifi only pushing two. Hard usage drops this but the inclusion of a fast charger, which works great, is appreciated A bigger capacity battery would have truly taking this phone to another level. If you can go the route of a 32Gb model I suggest you do as a total usable space of 10.17GB isn't much. Add some music and a couple of apps/movies/pictures and that number depletes quickly.Overall for the price (trust me I researched every available option) this phone in my opinion is one of, if not the best you can get for $300.

179879,Coofone Ultrathin Credit Card Size Mini Cell Phone 2G GSM Mobile Phone Unlocked (Blue),"Quality Technology Industrial Co., ltd.",We were looking for a easy phone for my Father-n-law but it is very small and the sound quality is not very good. We are going to use it for an emergency cell phone. As stated before it is small and would fit in a wallet (but would not recommend). The color is not really red but a light red and looks almost a dark pink. If you want an emergency phone then this would do. The battery lasts a long time on standby and the signal is pretty good. It is just not a everyday use phone. The display is small and sometimes the display is messed up. The ringtones are loud and it vibrates pretty good but the sound coming out to listen to is not for the hard of hearing. For $16.00 it was ok but would spend a little more and get a normal size bar phone for $20.00.,2,1

332499,Samsung Galaxy S Duos GT-S7562 GSM Unlocked Touchscreen 5MP Camera Smartphone White,Samsung,"We signed up with Consumer Cellular and received a simple Motorola phone, which we got good signal reception. No dropped calls, no problems. We wanted to cancel our wired phone and dial-up internet connection, so we purchased the Samsung Galaxy S Duos s7562 to use as a phone and an internet hotspot for our computers. The Duos was not receiving any signal and it wasn't until I worked with Consumer Cellular tech support, that I discovered it was not really misconfigured or broken. By climbing to the roof on a nearby building, I was able to connect and place a telephone call. It reminds me of the ""Green Acres"" telephone situation, which was mounted on a phone pole, due to the lack of wire, at the time of installation. Other than that, the device looked neat and might be fine for someone who lives and works in a strong signal area. This may or may not reflect on the results you get with your own Samsung Galaxy phone.",2,1

132350,BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (Black/Red),BLU,"We purchased two of these for travel to Italy and couldn't be happier. We picked up a SIM from TIM mobile (Italy's largest cell provider offered a sim with 300 minutes and 300 outbound texts for about 20 Euro) and the phones worked as expected for texting and phone calls, which is just what we needed to communicate when our family split for separate excursions or to contact locals.Two annoying things about our phones: (1) I couldn't easily discover how to do a keyboard lock, so there were many instances of pocket dialing ... eventually, I found the feature exists as an auto-lock: menu>>settings>>security settings>>auto keypad lock. (2) The battery level indicator always showed full, even when the battery was dead.In case anyone is interested, here are three annoying things about TIM Mobile (I wanted Vodaphone, but couldn't find a shop nearby): (1) The date and time were not auto-set by TIM, so we were always looking at a date in 1980 ... this is not a phone issue, but an issue with compatibility with TIM ... when we got back to the USA, the TIM SIM locked onto AT&T and the date/time were properly set. (2) TIM will initially allow international texting, but will eventually block it ... I had heard this was the case a few years back, but I thought they no longer did it. They do, and I believe you have to go to a TIM store and get the feature re-enabled. (3) TIM does not have an English option, so everything will be in Italian.",4,3

It's not compatible with many of the features you may have expected it to be.For example, they are currently running a promotion for a $200 certificate if you buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and activate Samsung Pay -- but apparently Samsung Pay is not supported on this phone. When I reached out to Samsung tech support about it, the tech claimed that this particular phone is not eligible, and they wouldn't discuss the certificate. I even checked the fine print and could not find the details -- all of the ads just say that the ""Note 5"" is eligible.Microsoft office (and other apps): There are a number of apps on the Google Play store that are listed as ""not compatible"" and can't be installed, including Microsoft office -- the free Microsoft office for android is a staple for mobile devices, so seeing that this isn't supported is a shock.Additionally, my experience with Samsung tech support were terrible. The person over chat was not helpful, and told me to call tech support. When I called tech support, they disconnected me twice. At one point, they even seemed to connect me to some sort of spam service that was trying to sell me on some things that sounded like a hoax (a $100 certificate for $2 and a free ""help I've fallen and I can't get up"" type monitor) -- the only thing I can imagine is that instead of connecting me internally, they misdialed. After 3 attempts, I still have not talked to a right person.So beware that you may not be getting what's advertised, and that tech support may not supportive in solving problems (Samsung is a far cry from Apple and Amazon support which is always great).",1,19

This covers everything I could possible ask a device like this to do.The 9005 version will do 4K video (some of the other 900 models do not), but it's almost a non-factor. The bitrate is too low for any real quality difference. In fact, I recommend using standard 1080@60fps video recording. You will get better results. Until 4K video recording technology catches up to the level displays have gotten, 4K isn't really practical yet.This one was configured for the French market I think. So you may have standard French apps, and some language settings you need to change. Not a big deal.",5,3

The first is the volume is terrible if you don't use earbuds, but superb if you do. Second is the screen shot.

162122,BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,"Very good phone. Very thin and light. You will need to buy a rubber case, and a hard glass screen protector to help protect the phone from drops, and the ever so dangerous, accidentally sitting on it. It seems like it will break if sat on (hence the need for extra protection), it's that light and thin. The 16GB is plenty for me, mainly because I use a cloud for all of my photos, so I only use the internal space for apps.But super fast, tons of personalizing options, no lag, great ear piece sound, and long battery life provided you use the Battery Doctor app. My phone lasts two days on a single charge with medium smartphone usage (mainly streaming live sports), and heavy camera usage (I am a photographer).And BTW, the camera is fantastic. Great colors, sharp crisp and clear photos with auto focus, and lots of in phone editing options. As well as great low light performance. Still not as good as my DSLRs, but super high quality photos for a smartphone.This is the second BLU phone my family has purchased, and we love them. There is no need to spend between $400 and $700 for a quality smartphone, when there is the BLU family of great smartphones!One more thing, the negative reviews about BLU seem to be coming mainly from competitors, and people with a less than friendly relationship with technology. The only downside to these phones is that they do need to be restarted more often than the brand name phones, not that often, but still more than say a Samsung. But that is a small price to pay for saving around $500 on a phone that will last just as long.Now do the right thing, save yourself a boatload of cash, and buy this phone!",5,1

Initially, this phone described as ""Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini G800F Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 16GB, White"" seemed very appealing and appropriate as the key words 'Unlocked' and 'International' expressed such ideas. However this phone is far from being International as the very box explains with the writing of ""European"" at the top. This phone only accepts European Sim cards and is overall okay for Europe usage (judging by the charger). I cannot confirm if the phone is in fact unlocked as my Sim could not fit the (International) slut. Furthermore, the manual was written in an unidentifiable language without the standard option of an English translation, (the International language of the world) THIS PHONE SHOULD NOT CARRY THE AFOREMENTIONED DESCRIPTION AS IT IS CERTAINLY FAR FROM BEING SO AND IS VERY MISLEADING AS A RESULT.

I would never have imagined that its late 2015 replacement would make my old Nexus 5 look like a speed demon.Laggy response in too many circumstances to name. Seems to stop responding to touch input for several seconds, then suddenly catches up and tries to process all your buffered inputs. Freezes and/or spontaneously reboots at least once every 72 hours. Massive color distortion in photos taken using any kind of digital zoom (sample attached).I hunted for tips to solve known bugs/issues. Found some that looked promising, but none were effective.

I have a case and screen protector on it. I squatted to pick up something i dropped, it fell out of my pocket. Fell about 2 feet onto the driveway. And shattered. Pic included. This is NOT a regular sony xperia. This is nothing more than a cheap replica. It overheats, all the time (No video longer than 5 mins or it shuts off from heat), it has s***ty 4g service (all other phones in the house, same carrier, have full service), and broke after falling 2 feet.I love the Sony Xperia series of phones. The price point is similar to older galaxies, with better specs. I use my phone for just about everything. Decent graphics. Good processing speed. Water proof up to 30 ft for 30 mins. The new z3+ has removed the port cover over the charging hole so the worn gasket is no longer an issue. Light weight. Perfect size for me excellent rf camera.The other xperias I had I got thru tmobile.

162385,"BLU Vivo XL Smartphone - 5.5"" 4G LTE - GSM Unlocked - Chrome Silver",BLU,"Update: after owning this phone for a while, I think 4 stars is fair. The major annoyance I have that is a regular thing is the weak GPS ability. It takes a good minute or so to start getting accurate driving directions anywhere, where my Nexus would instantly get going. The map bounces around, my location scrambles all over the place, shows my location in the wrong area ranging from a couple streets over to a mile away. Eventually it figures itself out, but when you need quick directions, this phone fails. That, and the continued super annoying bottom-up swiping drawer are my only complaints really.Original review:This is a good phone. I decided to take a chance with a brand I didn't really recognize, but they seemed to have really, really good reviews across all online retailers that sold them. I went with the Blu Vivo XL primarily because of the good reviews and generally comparable/slightly better specs than my Nexus 5 that crapped out.The good:- Big, bright screen with vibrant colors. A totally different experience than my Nexus 5. The bigger screen is cool too, I'm not sure if I can ever go back to something smaller.- Good performance. Handles everything I've thrown at it with ease. Very smooth operation.- The back button is on the right instead of the left, which is easier for me being right handed, I'm not stretching my thumb all the way across to hit ""back""- Minimal crapware installed from the beginning, some of it is removable- SD card slot, which my Nexus didn't have- Loud speaker phone- Camera is sharp, accurateThe bad:- The app drawer/tray thing slides up from the bottom instead of down from the top. I frequently trigger it to slide up while typing or scrolling, which is REALLY annoying. This is probably the main detractor- Although it operates smoothly 99% of the time, occasionally has some graphical ""glitch"" tendencies. Hard to explain, but transitioning between apps or closing apps makes this happen most frequently. Usually a chunky framerate, or temporarily frozen screen for a second- Touch screen seems slightly off with accuracy. I find myself having to press 2-3 times to get things to register once in a while, whereas Nexus 5 never had this issue- No upgrade to later versions of Android as far as I know, without rooting and doing a bunch of extra work- 720p resolution rather than 1080p. Not a huge thing and less noticeable than I thought it'd beI really, really like this phone and would recommend it to others. The negatives are more than made up for with the positives. I'm still surprised it's only $150 too. Incredible price for what you get.",4,1
238700,Life One X Quad Band Unlocked - 16GB (White),BLU,"Update 6/26/14: I am returning my Blu phone for reasons listed in the bad part of my review. Also uploaded pictures of performance testing and error messages.Update 6/23/14: Blu has been promising an Android KitKat software update for months and have missed every deadline they set. Today I read an interview on AndroidGuys where the CEO Samuel Ohev-Zion said that if you want the latest operating system (that they had promised) you should sell your old phone and buy a new one with that software. I think that is horrible service.Good:Its decently priced and has a big bright display. It does offer dual sims although they don't really work. Supports multiple GSM frequencies of 850/900/1800/1900 MHz and HSDPA 900/2100 MHzMediocre:I bought this phone because I was impressed with its specs. When I started using it I noticed it lagged anywhere it needed graphics. Even simple video games with 2D graphics would freeze. I downloaded Antutu which is an app that tests all aspects of the phone and tried it out.I was really surprised to find that the Blu Life One X was slower than a Nexus 4, and even slower than a Samsung Galaxy 3. Basically the Blue One X has better hardware but the older phones work MUCH better. I did some research and found out its because Blu uses cheap memory which perform HORRIBLY. The RAM (where android operating system runs) and flash storage (where pics and apps are stored) run about the same speed as phones that came out 2-3 years ago.Bad:Occasionally when I try to make calls I get a message that says ""Call not sent, no valid number entered."" and I have to try 3 or 4 times before it will dial through.The GPS only works about 70% of the time and often takes several minutes to lock. Doing a side by side comparison with Google Maps and Waze using the Blue One X, A Samsung Galaxy 2 and a Nexus 4 the Blue One X was always the last phone to lock into GPS and find streets correct. It often took twice as long as the other phones.Another issue is that Blu uses a different address book and dialer than the standard android OS. This causes it not to sync well with things like Google Voice or Google address book or ViberDual Sims- I have multiple sims cards so I tried out the dual sim feature. Tmobile in the #1 slot and ATT in the number #2 slot. So far I have not been able to dial out at all using ATT when both slots are full. If ATT is the only sim in the phone works fine. Put Tmobile back in and no matter what I try I cannot make calls using ATT.Data through the dual sims is a bit of a hassle. It takes nine clicks to switch between data services and then you have to wait about 10-15 for the transfer to complete.Lastly even though Blu promised an Android update months ago, this phone is still running Android 4.2. Blu's CEO was quoted in an interview that if people want the newest version of Android they should buy a new phone.Summary: Don't buy this phone for the Dual sim, that feature doesn't work. Blu has not updated the phone once as promised and likely won't provide regular updates. The specs are misleading and this phone performs poorly. If you want an inexpensive phone that performs well and gets regular updates there are many better choices (used Samsung Galaxy 3 or Nexus 4 both cost less and are faster, work better, have newer versions of android).",3,9
236451,"LG Quantum C900 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7, QWERTY Keyboard and 5 MP Camera - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",,"Update 5/20/12I've now had this phone for over a year. I've purchased at least three of them for friends in Africa. And I had to replace mine after I lost one in Uganda. I'm currently in Ghana and this phone continues to amaze me as a world phone. My Droid 3 is helpless outside the US because Verizon has disabled data access if you don't have their SIM card in the phone which means a huge data bill. But this LG Quantum really works well as a world phone. I get 3G data using just airtime credits with MTN in Uganda and Ghana whereas I have to pay for a data bundle with other cell carriers in these countries. The battery lasts over 2 days with moderate usage and switching between WiFi in the hotel to 3G on the road. My new Sony Ericsson Experia Arc S is a great Android world phone. Except I have to pay for a data bundle. The Quantum has a much smaller screen so I use the Experia for reading digital library books and listening to music. But the Quantum gives me fast Internet access. So it has it's place. I have my own ringtones in each phone. In my Quantum I use a Bob Marley tune. He's hugely popular in Africa. Use Dropbox to set up a Ringtones folder that will be synced to your phone. Create a ringtone on your PC and drop it in the Dropbox Ringtones folder. It will appear on the Quantum if you have Dropbox installed. Then choose it as your ringtone. Mango is a solid operating system. I've had no trouble with crashes with Mango. And Windows Phone 7 has a good variety of apps. Some are better on Windows 7. Some are better on Android. But you can do just about anything you need on both operating systems. The slide out keyboard on the Droid 3 is better than on the Quantum mainly because of the larger size. But they are both better than having to use a screen keyboard if you're a touch typist. Another plus for the Quantum is the price has dropped so low now you can afford to take it traveling and not worry too much about a huge loss if you lose it in the bush like I did.For a versatile phone in the US pick something else. But for a world phone the Quantum is still a contender and quite a bargain at current prices.------------------------------------------------------------I've had my LG Quantum since April 2011 when I purchased it for trips to Africa. It's worked well in Uganda where the MTN Uganda SIM card gives you 3G without having to pay for a data plan. You just buy airtime cards. Mali doesn't give you 3G at all. In the US the Quantum is just an OK cell phone. I get anywhere from 8 hours to a day and a half on the battery with little to no usage. I believe it's because the AT&T signal is non-existent in my home so the AT&T shop gave me a MicroCell to use. Going in and out of the house where the phone has to switch between regular cell and MicroCell seems to nail the battery. Also the wireless signal is weak at the far end of our house where my office is. A weak wireless signal also seems to cause the phone to use excess battery. At times the phone will heat up very hot and consume huge amounts of battery. I have three different LG OEM batteries. And they all behave the same. This is my second LG Quantum since I lost my first one in Africa. Both phones have the same heating and excessive battery use problem. Right now in the US I've removed the SIM card and switched my AT&T service to another phone. With the SIM card removed and with the phone on but not being used it lasts for nearly two weeks on standby. So the problem seems to be with how the phone manages varying cellular and wireless signals.I now have a Motorola Droid 3 GSM world phone. It is light years ahead of this Windows 7 phone. The Droid 3 also has the slider keyboard. There's no need for the awful Microsoft Zune program for transferring photos and files from and to the phone from the Droid 3. Hook up the Droid 3 to my laptop via USB and it's just another SD card. Or transfer photos or files via wireless to any computer on my home wireless network using the ES File Explorer app. Transferring photos taken on the phone can be a big issue if you use the phone camera for those spur of the moment candid shots like I do. It was painful to set up file transfer with the Windows 7 phone. And I've done it for 4 different Quantum phones. It doesn't get any easier with practice. The LG Quantum camera takes good quality photos in full daylight (forget night photos). But if you don't have your laptop handy to connect with Zune you can't transfer the photos off the phone. At full high resolution the photos are much too big to email. When I lost my first phone it's the photos I lost. Everything else was safe in the Google cloud and in Dropbox. With my Droid 3 I can transfer the photos at any time to either or both my Android Toshiba Thrive tablet and my Windows 7 laptop either via wireless or using a USB cable.This LG Quantum doesn't handle a weak phone or wireless signal well. My Droid 3 functions perfectly in such places where I got no signal on the Quantum. Besides requiring the Zune software the Windows 7 phone for any transfer of photos, music, or files it can't be used as a wireless hotspot. If you have a wireless-only tablet that's a big issue. The Droid 3 works seamlessly as a hotspot. It's included in the basic Android 3.2 software.For a first smartphone the LG Quantum may be a so-so choice. But it's got a lot of problems. If any of these problems might impact your cell phone usage you might want to keep looking. There are newer phones that might offer a better experience.",3,2
269256,"Nokia Lumia 800 Unlocked GSM Phone with Windows 7.5 OS, 3.7"" AMOLED Multi-Touchscreen, 8MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM Radio - Black",,"UPDATE #3: I just realized I completely forgot to mention certain carrier info. I'm using the phone with AT&T in NYC. Doesn't work with their HSPA+ (yet? I believe there will be a way to enable the frequency) as far as I can tell but I get 3mbit downstream and 1mbit upstream, which is a-OK.UPDATE #2: Flashed the new 11501 firmware. Battery problem be gone! I unplugged my phone at around 1AM and left it idling. It's now 330PM and battery still at 58% with normal use from 9AM. Great job Nokia. I haven't noticed anything else other than the battery fix though. Added the last star :)-------------------------------------------------------You can love or hate Windows Phone OS, but you have to admit, Nokia sure stepped up their game in designing this beauty.HARDWARE:""Borrowed"" heavily from its N9 sibling, this is one stunning phone to look at. Poly-carbonate body means very scratch resistant and none of that slippery glass surface, unlike a certain smartphone. The curves also make it very comfortable to hold, especially over a long period of time, also unlike a certain square-ish phone. Speaker and microphone neatly at the bottom while micro USB port and sim slot are at the top.The screen is amazing. The 3.7"" Clearblack LCD (aka Super AMOLED or whatever you want to call it) gives you such vibrant colors that my retina-display iPhone 4 looks like a last-gen screen next to it, at least in terms of colors and contrasts. The touchscreen is very sensitive, though I've noticed it can be a bit jumpy at times. No idea if it's a software or hardware problem, or just my screen protector.The only problems I have with the designs are: a) the dedicated camera button. It's a two-stage shutter (slightly press to focus and fully to shoot) is a bit flimsy. b) the micro-USB port cover flips up and can easily be broken. And it stays this way while connected. (This has been remedied with the upcoming Lumia 900 btw.)Overall, this is the best looking phone I've seen in years. Kudos to Nokia for trying something new. And dare I say, they succeeded brilliantly.SOFTWARE:It's Windows Phone 7.5 Mango. You either love it, or hate it.Let me say that coming from Android/iOS, the first main differences I saw were the big and bold tiles, and the minimal homescreen. No gazillions of icons and folders cluttering up the screen. Everything is right there, in your face. Phone, SMS, Mail, Browser are all there and easily accessible the moment you turn on the screen. Very cool, I thought. But then, as an avid app user, I loaded up the Windows Marketplace. And boy, was I in for a huge disappointment. I'd known that this was a new ecosystem and there wouldn't be that many apps yet. But I didn't think that many of the iOS/Android apps (not games, don't care about those) that I often used wouldn't have an alternative for WP (more on this later).I was ready to return the phone. But then (yes, another turning point), I started using it. And I fell in love. The way Live Tiles work, instant updated info without loading the apps. The way ""People"" combines all/most of your social networks into one place. The way I stopped using my phone to do useless things and actually get stuff done. And of course, the way the Lumia 800 felt in my hands. Also, slowly, I started discovering new ways to find the apps that I want/need. Sure, I had to compromise and discarded certain apps that I don't really need, but I did manage to gather a good number of apps in the end.Windows Phone 7.5 isn't perfect. I still hate the way copy/paste is implemented. I still think the keyboard is awkward at times and too sensitive at others. I hate that there's no jailbreak/root, or as WP users call it ""Interop unlock"". Or how background tasking has a 9-processes limit. Or how there's no way to change text size in SMS. Or that the default Marketplace is rather unwelcoming and harder to navigate. And many more. But these minor bugs and inconveniences all become irrelevant when you look at the big picture. Windows Phone 7.5 is a brilliant mobile OS. You might call it the smartphone OS for newbies. I'm guessing the reason why it hasn't attracted that many people yet is the lack of quality phones. We haven't seen anything that is so stylish, so cool that can actually compete with the annual iPhone and monthly Androids. Until now.I'm definitely getting a Lumia 900 when it comes out in a few months (though I'll miss the curved glass). Good job Nokia and Microsoft. You've won me over.Update: I forgot to mention that the 800 has battery issues (doesn't last very long). I hear that there's a new update out that has fixed this problem, but I'm still waiting for them to push it out to my phone. Will confirm when I get it.",5,57
229086,"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smart Phone, 5.2"" Ice Blue, 32GB Storage, US Warranty",LG Electronics,"UPDATE - I increased one star after months of usage; see below for more details.Ok... This is my honest review. First, the phone looks awesome. I like it is light and it is fast enough during normal usage. Screen looks incredible (compared to my old HTC One M8 GPE). Camera is great; really really great. Fingerprint reader works fast and it is very accurate. The speaker (single mono speaker) is kind of bad... maybe I have been spoiled by the HTC ONE M8 boomsound (stereo and very loud speakers), but at least they do the job. Now, I pay a lot of attention to the audio output with headphones and, even though the volume is a lot softer than the M8, the quality is actually pretty good. I use a pair of Shure SE425 and they work really well with the phone. Lots of details and very nice response for music (mainly Heavy Metal, Jazz, and Latin/Salsa genres).Now, the bad part... The first thing I noticed was the Light sensor... It is bad. It goes high and goes low all of a sudden, no smoothness in decreasing or increasing the brightness of the screen. You can turn it off and manually adjust the brightness, but it could be really challenging adjusting the brightness in direct sun light. Next, the phone stopped charging without any reason! It just stopped. After moving the cables from one side to another it started charging again. All of a sudden, it stopped again... One has to play with the cable in order to get it working. I contacted LG about this and they informed me that the phone did not have ANY WARRANTY in the USA. I bought the phone directly from AMAZON.COM it even the instruction booklet states the warranty is for USA. After closer examination of the phone, I also found a huge dead pixel. I pushed LG until they agreed in honoring the warranty. The screen was replaced after 1 week of repair time frame and it came back with a RED SCREEN of DEATH. I have to manually install the ROM via SDK Tools (unlocking the bootloader and using Fastboot prompts) in order to get it working again... VERY VERY BAD LG!!!! Next I noticed the screen has a lot of light bleeding at the top. I had to sent it back once again... In addition, the vibration motor is very noisy (in silent environments it bothers people around you) and the battery life is weak (so far, it lasts a lot less than the M8).In general, I am fan of Google Nexus line, but this one did fail for me. Lg did not pay attention to small details in this phone. Audio could be a lot louder, the speakers could have been stereo, and that light sensor... it might be fixable via software update, but I do not think it will happen considering Google usually ignores these ""minor"" issues. In general, I am very disappointed with the phone despite it is not a bad phone, this is more about the details more than the core of the phone. I ordered the Nexus 6p and I will be comparing these two soon. If you order this, try to do it from the Google Play Store or directly from AMAZON and check the warranty with LG as soon as you get the phone... but so far, it seems to me LG does not pay attention to any details in terms of construction and warranty fulfillment!UPDATE - 04-10-16Well, after months of usage it has gotten better after normalization of usage. Watching videos will kill your battery, it has a poor battery life for watching videos. So, if you like to use your phone as a media powerhouse, keep the original charger around with you; it charges very fast! Last software update (March, build MHC19J) improved the phone overall performance. I am very happy with it now.Compared to the Nexus 6p, it is a very capable phone. I did not notice any significant difference in overall performance (even before March update). I sold the N6p due its size; it is too big for me. In addition, I really prefer the N5X LCD screen against the AMOLED. But, the real deal breaker for me with the N6p was the audio. The N5X has a lot better audio than the 6P through the 3.5mm output jack. It is a shame that the ""premium"" phone has such a poor audio experience! The 6p has an aluminium body and feels heavier, but the N5X feels very solid and I frankly prefer lighter phones. Nexus 5X is a 4 star if you get a working phone (I had to send it for warranty two times, but now it is good) and if you ignore small details (no stereo speakers and a very annoying vibration module; I turned off almost every vibration feedback of the UI). For $380 it is a 3.5 star phone, for $350 it becomes a 4 stars... $300 is a steal (32gb version that is... 16gb is a no go for me!).",4,3

265920,"Nokia Lumia 1020 32GB Unlocked GSM Phone w/ 41MP Camera 4.5"" - White - International Version, No Warranty",Nokia,"Top10cell SERVICEBefore purchasing, I contacted Top10cell to make sure the model I would get is the RM-875, the international version. They were very polite and fast in emailing me back with the confirmation. The earliest expected delivery date was Jan 18th, and yet I received it on the 15th for standard shipping. Thus, their service is just simply great.MODEL CHECKINGThere are at least 3 ways to make sure which model is which. 1st, on the box there's a tag where you'll find the supported 4G LTE frequencies. The RM-875 model includes the 2600 Mhz frequencies (according to Wikipedia). 2nd, the RM-875 has radio, which the RM-877 doesn't (according to another site I forgot). 3rd, you can choose from Settings- Extras and info - More info. My phone says it's updated to Windows 8.1 with Lumia Cyan already installed. 4th, the charger is built for European and Asian used, which means the 2 plugs are cylinders, not flat. Thus an adapter is included. Also, you'll find that the manual is in another language other than English (Finnish I believe). You can download the English version online. Really easy.THE PHONEI. THE BATTERYI've been using it for nearly 2 weeks. I downloaded a few games to test the wifi connection, play those games and watch Youtube videos to see how much battery there is. The condition of testing is the same for every time(until it reaches 10% (battery critically low notice, repeatedly with no stop) (I tested 3 times at least):1) Watching HD Youtube clips : 05 hours straight ( I watch an 11-episode documentary called ""Battlefield Vietnam"", each of which lasts on average 50 minutes. I had to watch it closely as Youtube run on IE doesn't switch to the next episode automatically)2) Taking photos (shooting, cropping, uploading them to Onedrive using wifi...: 06 - 6.5 hours3) Listening to Radio Mix: about 08 hours (I played ""Best of 2014"")4) Wait time: >= 1.5 days. There's a clip on Youtube showing a man having this phone on after more than half a day with seemingly a fine amount of battery life remaining. That could happen. I unplugged this phone 02 days ago at 07am and at 06pm today (nearly an hour before I post this review), there's still 24% remaining.5) Charging time: =< 01 hour to FULLY charge, using the original charger (1.5 A output)==> Battery-wise conclusion: I can definitely get AT LEAST 01 DAY out of this phone.II. FUNCTIONALITY1) You'll have Onedrive, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote ready for nearly any kind of Office work. You can sync your Calendar, Skype,... with other Windows devices of yours.2) There's one thing only to mention regarding the best Camera: it is true as some Youtube clips have mentioned: if you let the phone capture the photo without any selections (ISO, weather, contrast...), the photo may come out a bit too vivid to be realistic. Other than that, if you're willing to learn how to utilize all of these features, you'll have the best phone-mera on the market.3)The app-store is true to be inferior compared to that of Android and iOS, but it can support the common: OneBusAway (OneBusAway for Windows is different from that of Android and iOS, but quite easy to get used to), Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Candy Crush, Temple Run, ... I use it mainly for work and sometimes sightseeing so this is just fine.===> Conclusion: If you use Windows devices for work, need to be up to date on the run, and enjoy taking photos/ shooting HD videos, I think this phone could be a very fine choice of yours.I'll update anything else later. Hope this helps.UPDATE (Mar 30th, 2015)I received it on Jan 05th, 2015, so it's been nearly 3 months since then. I'm updating information about the phone, regarding both BATTERY and FUNCTIONALITY:1) BATTERY: When I discussed this previously, I didn't do the followings: a) Have 2 of my email accounts synced and updated ""as item arrives"" b) Install Twitter, Fb, LinkedIn, Skype, Instagram, Flickr, SurfCube...==> Thus, after having done all of this, the battery is drained significantly faster. For instance, 06 minutes of Skype using Wifi will cost 4% of battery, constantly checking for emails, calendar... will severely dry the juice as well. As a result, this morning I unplugged it at 6am with 100% battery, at 11h00 am it dropped down to less than 10% after my checking emails, using Messenger constantly for less than half an hour, which meant most of the time it stayed on stand-by mode. ( I don't watch Youtube clips, checking Facebook as much as emails, and I haven't had a SIM card for this phone yet as I'm still under contract with another one. I have no idea what it'll be like texting, making phone calls, storing text messages and contacts...) Thus, battery-wise, this is the worst phone I've had, even worse than the last S4.2) FUNCTIONALITY: a) There's no Outlook or Gmail app on the phone, except for one Email app. As mentioned, I linked the 2 inboxes together. This linked inbox doesn't do its job as well as the S4, i.e. emails are updated much more slowly than on the laptop (I'm using an old version Transformer book of Asus). b) Internet Explorer is absolutely crappy. It suddenly crashes when I'm surfing the web or watching a five-minute Youtube clip. SurfCube is better in terms of web surfing, but when I try logging in on Facebook using this, it doesn't load, and it crashes when I watch Youtube clip. c) The wifi reception is even more annoying: It seems like Windows phone can't compete with iOS and Android in this as wifi reception on this phone is inferior to those. I've had to turn off then on the wifi networking just to get signals, or even restart the phone. I don't know how the call and text signal will work, but this wifi reception and the pathetic battery life are annoying me even more than playing Flappy bird.I know what I signed up for. I only didn't expect it to be worse than I thought. If you still want to have this phone, I suggest buying a camera grip, not the Windows one, but the one on Amazon with 3000 mAh ( I don't see it at this point but I hope it'll be back). The camera is a treat, only if you're willing to compromise that much. I'll update after having a SIM card to see what will happen.UPDATE (Oct 18th, 2015)It's been 10 months since I received the phone. My phone has been upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1 Denim, the latest version prior to Windows 10 for Phone. I've been using a nano-SIM card since May. Here's what been happening:1) BATTERY: I disconnected the linked email account and use only my Outlook with the same update setting (as-it-appears). Watching Youtube from full battery to shutdown is about 3 hours straight (I'm using UC Browser, it automatically plays the next clip on queue). Talk and text don't take out so much juice. Taking photos, shooting videos, web surfing (either by wifi or 4G).... do. Especially, even on standby mode, the battery is still drain, although not as significantly as it used to be. Overall, I can manage to get a day out of it with the following activities: Taking, editing photos (10+ photos), texting, web surfing, watching Youtube. TIPS: I've unpinned all apps, meaning after entering the password (if applicable), the scrolling list appears, leaving no Start screen. I hope it may help save some battery power. Furthermore, adjusting light intensity (Low, Med, High and especially Automatic, which dims the screen when the phone is used indoors and brightens under the sunlight) and Battery-saving options can help as well (though will limit functionalities, i.e. no automatic push mails, Facebook notification...)2) FUNCTIONALITY: a) Bing maps, HERE Maps, Google maps, Maps (pre-installed on phone) are ALL TERRIBLE. No web browser can load Bing or Google map properly, either on 4G or Wifi. HERE Maps and Maps don't have the diverse options like Google maps (bus routes for instance) and sometimes crash. I don't know why, but it's what I've facing. b) The Lumia Camera now allows photos taken in DNG format. As far as I read and experience, it seems to have a better view and more realistic. Taking photos at night time and/or low light situations, against light appear to be improved. Yet, photos are still more vivid and far from what we see.==> CONCLUSION: I'm giving it 3 stars for the improvement, though I believe more must be done, which is easily seen in Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL, coming out this Fall. I think those improvements should be on the 1020.UPDATE: Nov 30, 2015It has crashed twice, i.e. nothing can be done until the battery is completely drained. The 2nd time just happened a few minutes ago, and the screen went awol. If after plugged in, the screen remains malfunctioning, I'll have to send it to repair, which will cost time, money and all of the data stored inside.CONCLUSION: This is absolutely not the type of experience any user wants. Thus, go with the high or low end, don't go with this kind of medium-entry phone.",2,5

90501,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,"To the extent I can love any phone, I love the new Blackberry Classic. I am coming from an iPhone 6, which was my first iPhone. I have previously been an Android user, first a Nexus 4 and then a Nexus 5. I also owned a Blackberry Q10 as a bridge phone between the Nexus 5 and the iPhone 6. What drew me back to Blackberry was the QWERTY keyboard and the Blackberry hub. I don't use tons of apps, but with the addition of the Amazon App Store to the newest version of Blackberry OS I can find almost all the apps I used regularly on iOS or Android. For the few exceptions, like the American Express app, the mobile site works very well and I don't feel like I'm missing out much not having the app. I've liked all the prior phones I've owned and Android and iOS both have their strengths and weaknesses. But the Blackberry hub integration so impressed while using the Q10 I decided to give the Classic a try. My original unit was defective, but thanks to Amazon's great return policy I was able to get a new Classic shipped to me within about a week. After inserting and initializing a T-Mobile nano sim, the replacement Classic works flawlessly (the original unit would not maintain a connection to a cellular network; some sort of problem with how the phone was reading the SIM card). Despite the hiccup with the defective unit, I am very much enjoying the Classic. I am not a power user, but greatly appreciate the simplicity of the Blackberry hub which integrates all my messages from email accounts, SMS, MMS and social networks in to one place. This is something neither Android nor iOS can do to the best of my knowledge. And I found it frustrating in Android and iOS to have to switch between applications to access different types of messages: iMessage texts, Gmail, Google Hangouts, Facebook et cetera. The hub sweeps all of these together and the messages are all in one place. This to me is the best feature of Blackberry OS. If you're a QWERTY fan and have been considering the Classic, it's a fantastic phone. I don't play a lot of games on my phone or watch a lot of media content. What I use the phone for is communication--lots of texts, emails, Facebook messages and phone calls. This phone handles all of those things beautifully. I appreciate some of the other features of Blackberry OS, like active frames, which to me is an interesting mash up between Android widgets and Windows Phone live tiles. I'll give the Classic another two weeks as my primary driver and then return my iPhone 6 which has been collecting dust. Most of my friends are aghast that I'd ""downgrade"" from the latest and greatest iPhone, but as many other reviewers have opined, a phone is a personal choice and you need to choose what works for you. When they see the hub they are always jealous and wish their phone could do that. And everyone loves a QWERTY keyboard, just not at the expense of screen real estate. If you're on the fence, try the Classic and see if it works for you. I'm glad I did.",5,8

321718,Samsung Galaxy Nexus GT-I9250 Unlocked Cellphone--International Version (White),Samsung,"To me, one of the most important Smartphone features is.. access to Emails. Yes. As simple as that. It took me a long time to decide what phone to get, but because email access seemed to me SO basic - that is, that I will be able to access (and sync) my work emails & calendar from Microsoft Exchange with the phone - that I didn't bother to check it in advance. It's been two weeks now of adding my Exchange account (approx. 5 attempts each time until you can access the server), then removing it, then adding again, just to find out that the emails did sync, but not the calendar, then removing, re-adding, to find out that calendar is there but no new emails are arriving/you can't send emails/can't send meeting requests etc. etc. etc. I did a lot of research and tried playing with the settings and what-not but to no avail. I found out that this is a pretty known and common problem with Android (iCS), since Google doesn't support all the exchange policies and protocols. Today I have given up and decided to get another email app (costs around $10). This is my first and last Android phone; if you are getting this phone so you can manage your work emails and meetings - get an iPhone.",2,1

The phone shipped out on 6/10. I finally received the phone 6/23. It was being shipped for USPS by a 3rd party carrier up until the time of delivery which was USPS. The shipping was free so I can’t complain. The phone itself is excellent!!! The screen is sharp and clear. The phone I received was unlocked. The issue I had was that it would not let me update the ROM. For the phone you are supposed to go to settings/updater – choose MENU and search for updates. My phone didn’t have the “search for updates”. I download the next update ROM from Huawei’s website, copied it onto my SDCARD in the phone, powered down the phone, held the power button while holding the volume up and volume down at the same time, released the power button when the HONOR logo appeared but keep the volume up and down pressed until the EMUI logo appeared and it then started loading the new software/ROM. After that completed I went into settings/updater/check for updates. There was an OTA update available which I loaded. My initial ROM was B009 and I updated to B012 then took the on-the-air update to B013. Oh, when I went to the B012 update it was missing the GAPPS but I was able to load it from the Huawei icon on the phone for their equivalent of Google Playstore. I have T-Mobile and the phone picks up on HSPA+ with no problem. I also have rooted the phone following the instructions from XDA developers. The rooting with this phone does not interfere with any OTA updates as I rooted it when it was on BO12 rom and took an OTA update to B013. The phone is well worth the money and I have shown it to many co-workers who will also be purchasing the phone.",5,6
272720,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Red,Nokia,"To begin I read about all the negative experiences with getting the right product. I did get the expected product...brand new and international. (Ordered from FGS Trading) The only hitch was it was definitely packaged for the European market as it arrived with a charging plug for the European use. I am in Canada. I have multiple 3.5 mm chargers so no biggie.Now on the phone. I first powered it on and had to change the language to English. Took all of 30 seconds. Holding the phone is a treat. To people who find this phone heavy. You should be concerned with the strength in your hands let alone the weight of this phone. This phone is meant be used with a slim case if any. It is extremely durable and you can feel the quality it it. To put it in perspective the famed iPhone 5 is 220 grams when adding on the very popular Otterbox Defender case. This phone weighs in at 185 grams. With my Nokia case (17 gms) it is 202 gms total. This makes that particular iPhone 5 and defender combo wider and heavier. You will rarely see people put this phone in a case. In fact there are not many cases made for this phone...maybe for that reason. Corning Gorilla Glass 2 also adds to this durability.It is definitely a looker. From front to back it just looks the business. I got the black matte to limit any possibilities and fingerprints and it just looks good. Colors are more likely to leave scratches as you can see with the iPhone 5c. They have the same case. Funny how apple has to make the iPhone 5c look so similar to that of Nokia colored phones but we will leave that topic alone.The fluidity of the phone is great... and simple. No clutter to report. I like having the ability to only have what I want on my home screen with the live tiles. All other apps are easily reached but tucked away. The camera of course is one of the most respected cameras on the market as Nokia is arguably the best on the market - the Lumia 1020 has taken away the steam of the 920 but it is still fantastic. I have used it for a month and my wife's iPhone does not compare. The screen is very good...uses the same technology as the iPhone 5s (IPS LCD)I really feel the app bashing windows gets is blown way out of proportion. Reason being is there are a lot of useful apps and its not cluttered with pointless ones (Something I experienced a lot with my Blackberry Z10 on blackberry world). I have found almost all the apps I would ever need. The third party counterparts are great unlike in blackberry world. I personally prefer quality over quantity. I really enjoy all the in house apps Nokia makes. Nokia MixRadio is fantastic as is their Camera app. Nokia Maps is very good and on par with Google Maps. Nokia makes so many of their own apps I find I am not needing to find the third party apps to use ad I prefer that as well.The only things I could think of that I feel could be improved upon is the lack notifications and the Windows keypad is not quite as up to par as the Blackberry10's (nothing comes close...including Apple and Android) Those are very minor issues and can be addressed with software updates.Anyone who says they are disappointed with this phone is weak handed and never gave it a chance and probably came from using an iPhone or Google and look at APP numbers. The Apps are coming. Apple has had 10 years to build up its app market...Windows is on 3. Its the experience I was after. I could afford an iPhone or an S4 but went with the Lumia. There is something about Windows 8 that is refreshing. Live tiles is a great concept that has potential to be more and who knows what will come with Windows Phone 8.1 update which is coming soon. That's my rant. If you like having the phone everyone else has stick to your iPhone. If you like to brag about specs get a top flight Android. If you prefer to have a lightweight operating system that just feels right...try a Lumia 920,1020 or above.",5,2

I've used some ""budget"" Windows phones from Nokia and decided to give the 950 a try a few months ago since it was being offered at a big discount to retail on Amazon. I liked Windows because I don't use a lot of apps (10-15 usually will do it) and all the ones I do use are on the platform -- if you are an ""app for everything person"" then Windows phones are likely not for you. The Windows 10 os makes *significant* improvements over the previous os and it feels like a well integrated, intelligent system to use.

(curiously, the warranty was 90 days.) first, it stopped keeping time. then every time i received a call, it would switch into another function so that the call ended up on voicemail. thinking that it might have needed a software update, i tried to hook the phone up to nokia's pc suite. in the past hooking up took anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour: it never worked the first try. so i spent an hour and a half without any success. i tried the support system in the past never with success. i was able to find a way to send the phone back--i have extended warranty from amex. but even if my phone would be fixed, i would still need to buy a new phone for the interim; moreover, i had no reason to believe the problems would be remedied. instead, i decided to take out my frustration by badmouthing nokia every chance i get for the rest of my life. no wonder that every other cell phone company is taking share from incompetent nokia.",1,8

262047,Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,"This was for my son to replace a phone he damaged at work. He is a college student, but is a foreman for his scene shop, so he's always on call. He needed a qwerty keyboard because he sends/receives so many texts about things at the theatre, that it's easier. BUT, due to his job, he's always banging himself (and phone) on wood pieces, metal grating, ladders, etc. SO a full screen front was out of the question.......that's how he damaged the other one. PLUS cost was a major factor knowing he'll damage it again, probably. He liked the fact that on the school wireless he could always check email with this phone, too. Again, important to his job. This phone is NOT 3G, it is NOT a smart phone, it is NOT able to access internet/email from anywhere. Just places where wifi is available (like a college campus).All that said, it fit the bill for him very well. He likes it thus far, though he's only had it at school less than 2 weeks. He says it seems fine for what he needed it for. The reason for 3 stars is just that for MOST folks this won't do as much as they want.However, if you're looking for a smartphone alternative for a college student who is nearly always on the school interface, this works as a very nice inexpensive alternative.",3,1

Everyone at Samsung was very courteous and polite but instructed me that the phone needed to be sent back for repair, as it was not a battery or charging port issue. Two days shipping, seven-to-10 days of repair, two days shipping back. A long time to go without a phone. Another problem was that no one at Samsung USA could identify the phone by it's manufacturer's numbers. One phone support person told me the phone was built in New Zealand. Another told me it was a UK model. Both sent me to those respective websites for further support. Both were dead ends. So I gave up and sent the phone back for a refund. The refund is still in process, but the seller has been very good about communication, and I'm confident they will make good. I bought a Moto G for half the price.

I have owned an LG Optimus Q (StraightTalk my first smartphone), Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and now a LG G3. I am not a LG fanboy it just worked out this way. After using the Optimus for a year and getting to know Android and Google I learned about the Nexus line. Needless to say it's the way to go, especially with the price of the N4. The N5 held the same pricing as the N4 so I updated. I wanted to update again this year to the Nexus 6 but Google changed the price. I wasn't going to pay $750 for a phone especially when it didn't include things the previous phone did (Slimport). Also I broke my screen about 2 months ago for the second time. So it was time to start looking for a new phone.This phone at this price is a steal. Then you include all the add-ons and its a no brainer.These are my reasons for the purchase:1. Price. $417. For the phone to be reduced $250 in 5 months is a good deal.2. Slimport. I like watching movies on my big screen or at a friends house. Chromecast is still a bit off with audio to picture sync.3. Battery. The battery life is impressing me. Blows away my N5 in this department. I listened to 5 hours of Sirius satellite radio with bluetooth going over wifi and I still had 72%. My N5 would have been down to the 20's%.4. Wireless ""Qi"" charging. Once you have it you won't go back to plugs and cords.5. Speaker. I wasn't looking at speakers since it didn't have front facing but I was extremely surprised. It's LOUD for a phone speaker. I compared to the N5 and its about 2X as loud. Sounds good too.6. Screen. The phone is only 1.5 centimeters taller than the N5 but has a screen a 1/2 inch bigger. Plus quadHD to boot. It is a stunning screen to look at. Very happy.7. FM radio. I haven't had this since the flip phone days, this is a nice perk.8. IR Blaster. How sweet is that. Being able to control TV's with my phone is sweet.I probably could make this a top ten list but when I was phone shopping I wanted what my Nexus 5 had and around the same price as I paid for that. This phone exceeds this requirement. I am so happy I got this phone. The UI is different than ""pure"" Android but I like it. Plus I can always add Nova launcher and just switch to that in Home. I hope this helps anyone weighing their options.",5,14

I have used this phone for almost a year now and so far it has been ok. The phone is a touch phone that comes with a little stylus, which is lost easily but very cheap and easy to replace if you buy spares on eBay. I barely use the stylus because I find it annoying, but when you want to press a smaller detail on the phone it's good to have. The display sort of looks like a wanna be iphone, and it responds fairly well to commands. The camera is nice and the video records fairly clear which is also nice.I have had to send mine in for service twice since I bought it, the first time for them to tighten the seams around when the phone locks and unlocks (it is a little switch that you push up to lock or unlock, which I find annoying and looks like it might break if you accidently push it too hard) which were coming loose, and the second time because my screen went black. While this was annoying, the good thing was that it happened within the warranty period so the fixed it for free both times. If you think somethign (and I mean anything)is wrong with the phone, call Nokia right away and don't linger until your warranty expires or else the won't fix it for free.The Bad-The phone is a fingerprint magnet and you will be constantly wiping-The screen is sort of plasticity feeling and not as nice as other touch screens-The phone is too thick, and if you get a cover(which you do need) it gets even thicker-The stylus is annoying and is easily lost-The graphics mess-up and freeze all the time, sometimes distort and you have to lock and unlock, or even reset in extreme cases, to fix them-Every couple of months the phone will get stuck and vibrate uncontrollably, you'll need to reset it to fix-It can sometimes get confused with orientation and won't known whether to be vertical or horizontal when you text-The setting take a little while to figure outThe Good-The phone is the nicest touch phone you'll find at such a low price-The customer service is helpful-It is very resilient for a touch phone and has withstood many falls and bangs (in part thanks to the case)-It seems like it will last you a couple years-It's a nice phone for someone on a budget who wants to get something a little nicer than a basic phone-You can browse the internet-You can download some apps and different features-I have never seen anyone else with the same phone at least here in Florida, and it seems to be a little more uncommon in the US, so you'll probably be the only person you know that owns one (which can be a good or a bad thing I guess)In conclusionIf you want a nice not too expensive touch phone, with some web capability get this phone, but if you're looking for and iphone or Android substitute look elsewhere. If you want a nice phone that will last you at least a year or two try this one out.",3,2

346074,Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-I337 Unlocked GSM Smartphone w/ 13 MP Camera - Red (No Warranty),Samsung,"This review will be less about the product itself (because we all know this is an amazing, powerful, fast, feature-packed flagship smartphone) and more about SIM Compatibility/Network. Because that's why we're looking at unlocked phones, right?I digress. In June, I bought the Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy SIII from WalMart for $459.99. I thought it an amazing purchase that I would not regret... I was so wrong. Little did I know it was a CDMA phone (locked to Straight Talk) and it ran on the SPRINT network. This meant little to me then, but it means the world to me now, because I now know that Sprint is the most awful, bogged-down, spotty, insert-derogatory-phrase-here network on this entire planet. I live in Hawaii, and Sprint's network in Hawaii is an absolute joke. I had no service at my own house OR my workplace that was right on the convergence line of two Sprint towers (Sprint can't switch towers very easily so just went into roaming). The closest Sprint tower to my house had a coverage radius of roughly 1 mile, and still does. And worst of all, it's a 3G-only network. Not a regular 3G network, either. I got EDGE speeds at best. I've never pulled more than 1Mbps on the up or down. Straight Talk's S3 was also very watered down, with a locked bootloader and very limited software accessibility. It was a sad life for me.I had had it. I was done with this pitiful excuse for a carrier. All my friends had either AT&T or Verizon, who both had full LTE buildouts here. They always pulled webpages and videos like lightning. Their coverage was broad and consistent. I figured it was time to pinch a few pennies. I had heard that Straight Talk had released an LTE-capable AT&T SIM Card, and I needed a phone for it to power. I had my heart pretty much set on the S4, but didn't know which one to get.This was the one.The product arrived brand-new and completely unopened. Shiny new S4. I put it in the wall, popped the SIM in, edited the APN settings ([...]) and BAM. The 4G LTE icon popped up in the status bar, as well as two consistent bars of service. My experience thus far has been wonderful - I've been pulling a pretty steady 15up/19down everywhere I've been thus far. I now have coverage in my home. I have yet to see the NO SERVICE icon. This may not be a problem for many of you as you may be already coming from AT&T's network - but it's a whole different world for me.TL;DR? This phone works perfectly with Straight Talk's AT&T Micro SIM card. There is no hassle and no fuss - I set it up entirely online in 10 minutes. If these qualifications meet your criteria, buy this sucker - you won't be disappointed.",5,111
207130,"LBER KR999 Classic Retro Thick Brick Cell Phone ( Ultra-long Time Standby , Loud Ringtone, Big Button , Large fonts , Big Speaker , Sim-Free and Unlocked ) - Black/White (White)",LBER,"This retro brick cell phone is the greatest, I love it so much that same day I received it I went to the AT&T store and wanted to add this phone to my cell phone plan. Their response was absolutely priceless, ""There is no way we can add this to your plan, anything from the 90s will not work on our current cell towers..."" I just laughed and said it looks retro but can be used to add to a cellular network. I was working with one of the sales guys in the store and this caught the attention of a coworker who was just drawn to this cell phone. She asked if she could call it and take a few pictures to send to her friends. I absolutely obliged, and listening to the ring tone for the first time was the icing on the cake. One of the ringtones default setting was a wedding tune very commonly played at weddings Canon in D, there is other settings but this one is my favorite. The other ring tones are the typical rings you would find in a phone from that era. I will display them in my video. I successfully added this cell phone to my plan with its own number the cost 9.99. This is only for the talk plan. Adding texting would have been an additional 30.00, this phone can text but I did not want to incur the added expense. Texting can be done using the old school T9. I proceeded to then call my mom on my ride home from the AT&T store with my new retro brick cell phone to try it out. I was able to hear my mom clearly using this phone to make the call and she was easily able to understand and hear me. I did not hear any static on the line or issues with the sound quality. I plan on keeping this phone on my family plan, for the 9.99 a month which is reasonable I can have a second line, and best of all I love the comments and people asking to take pictures with it. Most do not believe me that you can actually make a call as well as answer a call from this phone. I am always happy to let them try it out for themselves. This would make a perfect prop addition to a costume or if you are like e obsessed with retro items this not only looks like the classic retro brick phone but can work with today's technology. I have been taking this phone everywhere I go; pool, run errands out to dinner. It is a permanent fixture in my purse along with my iPhone Plus but since I received this phone I have been using it all the time over my iPhone Plus. My retro brick phone and the nostalgia that goes along with it. I keep the new number in my contacts under Zack Morris from Saved by the bell this phone reminds me of the 90s and that show. The charger that comes with the phone is a c charger, which also works in my car charger and any usb port I plug it into. My phone will never die on me when I am on the go. I have only fully charged it once and overtime I go to use it I have full battery life. I have never been so excited for a retro item than I have been for this retro brick cell phone, it exceeded my expectations. I am in love with it!!Pros:Plays music with a TF card/memory cardExcellent sound quality from my end as well as the party I am calling.Preloaded game-Monkey that climbs vinesDifferent ring tonestons of settings to customize it to my preferences.Caller id-logs missed and received and dialed calls in the log.Ability to store up to 250 contacts per sim cardFront display screens shows date and time.Calendar allows me to create lists or put an important task into with a reminderAlarm can be setCalculatorCons: Does not connect to wifi**I did receive this item for free for my honest and unbiased review.",5,1
263377,"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (Black)",Nokia,"This purchase was to replace my old XpressMusic 5530. Which I used for a phone and heavily used media player. Where the 5530 fell short, this one picks up. Anyone that had the 5530 or probably even the 5800, can tell very well of the bugs they had (shutting off when you tried to pick up a call, random freeze ups, very limited interface, the constantly disconnecting wifi, etc.).INTERFACE:The interface is much cleaner, smoother and a better tactile touch response. Compared to the 5530/5800 even with the SPB Mobile Shell customization, the c6 is a better performer. The wifi pickup is much improved as it will retain the wifi connection and quickly pick it back up if it is dropped.Response is much faster than the predecessors, yet still minimally sluggish. The improved audio is complimented by the larger screen. When playing movies the battery doesn't drain nearly as fast as the 5530 did due to it's larger capacity battery.BODY:It's size is a bit bulkier. But I prefer this one's larger size compared to the 5530 as it was just a bit too small for my hands. The side buttons for volume control, slide lock and camera button are a little difficult to press as the slide out keyboard causes a bit of an obsticle because it tries to slide out when pressure is applied.However, the slide out qwerty keyboard is a great gain. The buttons are a bit small for my large fingers, but typing on it produces significantly less errors than when I had to deal with the touch screen of the 5530.The Nokia tech support has been good to me thus far when I've had issues. I didn't have to deal with a bunch of beurocracy when they needed to cover my warranty. All in all, I'm glad I bought this phone. Due to the improvements and solidarity of the phone & customer service, I'll probably be upgrading this phone to another Nokia when it becomes out dated.",4,5

With prime, we got it next day and simply switched out the sim card with no major problems. I will give a small piece of advice for anyone who purchases this unlocked device to use with Straight Talk since this wasn't the first time I have used a non straight talk phone with the carrier. In order to get the phone to work completely (our internet wouldn't work outside of wifi at first), I had to change the settings a bit. You are looking to change the APN (Access Point Names) in settings->mobile networks section. If you have a straight talk phone already, you should be able to change the settings to match your old phone. If you are not tech savvy, look for a tutorial on youtube for guidance. Also, when we switched the sim car with all his contacts, it wouldn't call out to certain numbers. I played around with it a bit and figured out that it was because he didn't have a 1 in front of the numbers, Once he added that to all his contacts, the phone was fully operational.I would say this phone has some good upgrades from the S4 and some things that should have stayed the same, but those could just be preferences of my husband who isn't a fan of change or learning something new and a bit more complicated.

All they tell you is contact Sony Ericsson. When you call Sony Ericsson customer service, they're very arrogant, and all they try to do is to let you use their support page on their website.The phone is good looking and solid, however many reviewers in other places [...] have returned their phone due to faulty battery cover that wobbles, and the kickstand is loose and doesn't stay in place. Unfortunately these problem occurs when your 30 days are up and you cannot return your product for a full refund!SE claims a 8.1 megapixel camera, but that is far from taking great pictures, at best their okay!The case IC-45 that SE offers for the phone is generic (meaning not specially made for this model) and when you put the phone in there the latch doesn't close and you have to force it. Forcing it touches the off button and your phone is off without you knowing it. The belt case is made of plastic that is very hard to use and that it can break easily!The GPS program that come pre-installed is Wayfinder, and it's a European company not even comparable to Tomtom, Garmin. Telenav doesn't offer a program for this specific model and their CS is another story.So basically you're paying for a great looking phone without any support from your carrier and SE.The music player (Walkman) is great and sounds great! Youtube application doesn't work, you have to mess with the firmware and it's not recommended for none tech savvy people! (this is where you find that at&t doesn't care since it's not their branded phone and SE doesn't care since they really don't care after they sell you the device, and they tell you you should contact your carrier!).So, bottom line if you're tech savvy, you have $450+ to burn, and you change phone often then yes buy this phone by all mean. However if you want tech support, cheaper phone, buy a branded version from your own wireless carrier.[...]",3,5

It's been one week of use and I'm here with my fresh review!Pro:Camera: Camera takes amazing quality picture, the dual camera really does the trick. The contrast and the color/ shadow is the best I've seen.Battery: Honor 8 carries a 3000mAH non removable battery, because the screen is smaller and thanks to the ""app battery consuming reminder"", the phone can go 48 hrs effortlessly for moderate phone user. If you are a heavy user, I'll say 24hr. But hey, it's still pretty amazing.System UI: the UI provides a clear arrangement of the apps, the user-machine interaction is very smooth and easy.Finger print: How can I forget about this? The finger print button on Honor 8 is EVOLUTIONARY. With smart touch/slick function you can assign more app open task on to the button, let alone the sliding to see notification bar can really help the users with smaller hand.Notification LED: what it's in the dial speaker? Yeas please, this design definitely has made the phone look overall more tidy.Overall craftsmanship: The 15 layers of glass is really pretty. It's a shame that the blue one is not sold on Amazon so I got the white one, but it's still elegant although not as sleek as the black or the blue. But I'm a chick, I like white :P3.5mm phone jack: Can I just say how much I appreciated you guys have kept this? I mean can't I listen to some songs while I get my phone charged, with an outlet? lol.NFC: I don't have anything that I need to use NFC around me for now (because I live in Nevada..) but hey what if I move to bigger city in the future right?Eye protection mode: My momma doesn't have to worry that I hurt my eyes when I play with my Honor 8 at night! And more amazingly you can adjust the color temp on yourself.No pro nor con:Speaker: the dial speak is a blast, you can hear others in the phone loud and clear. For the speaker on the bottom, despite it is mono speaker, the sound quality is still very compatible.Con:Slippery like a butter in your hand. I dare not to bring this phone out of the house before my non-slippery case arrives. Heard too many tragic stories on how owners get too excited on their Honor8 and cracked the front and the back. Tsk tsk.Quick settings bar can fit more settings com'on! Only 9? I have ADHD and I can't deal with this LOL.I'll add more reviews as time goes by. But I hope the info above can help!",5,29

I later found out they had not cared to inform customers to remove the plastic lining from the battery in the instructions. A mishap on the manufacturer's or HTC's part. Also, when I finally first turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, and some text still stay in Chinese even after I changed the setting to English, I'm still not fond of the huge foreign charger with adapter that came with the phone. This phone was also not sent to me within 3-5 business days of ordering, which was when I needed it before my trip. I also saw this phone online now for a lesser price and twice the storage. Not only that, but the seller was also upsetting when I told them I wanted to return the phone, they rudely said they were going to charge me a ridiculous restocking fee of 30% not including the shipping and handling fees to return the phone.

It's not very intuitive...maybe just because I'm so used to a smart phone. This is the only reason I could come up with to ding my review rating to 4 stars. I really only bought this phone as a pay-as-you-go phone to allow me to port my home number to this phone and then to a GoogleVoice #. I did play with the phone for the few days it took to get things all ported over between different services. I had to use it to answer several calls with our home number. The sound was pretty good. No complaints there. It was just like any other phone I have had before I got a smart phone. Overall for the price of this phone, it is a GREAT Deal.The whole phone is really just plastic and the back seems kind of cheap, but hey...what can you complain about when you only pay $18 for a cell phone. My kids don't have a cell phone, and I certainly don't intend to give them a smart phone. I do plan to hold onto this phone as I contemplate allowing my kids to have a pay-as-you-go phone for emergencies. This is great as a starter phone for them.This phone does have FM radio available. That's kind of cool. It's WAY too easy to turn it on accidentally, and if you're not used to it, it's hard to figure out how to turn it off. That happened when I took it in to the phone provider to activate it. We spent the next 10 minutes pushing buttons trying to turn it off. I'm sure you'd get used to this if you used it regularly.I didn't add any photos as I think the photos in the listing are quite sufficient.Oh, one other thing...I wish it came with a manual. Not a big deal I guess as I was able to locate it online. Some of the buttons aren't labeled or in intuitive locations which kind of made it hard for me to figure it out at first.",4,4

Wanted to make sure everything worked well and that it would hook up to my carrier. I have it hooked up with Tracfone. Had to use an older Data APN setup (like we did with our LG Sunset phones TFDATA instead of their newer PRODATA) to get the G4 to work in our area. I was able to get my old number, time, and minutes transferred to this phone once I received their sim card. Since I carry the phone in my purse, the size is great. The battery seems to last as long as my other phone. I bought the flip circle case from newisdom and use a qi charger most of the time. Exception is when the battery gets real low then I plug the phone in standard. I also put a silicone case (youwatch) on the back of the phone to help protect the camera and in case I drop the phone. The flip circle case replaces the back cover and does not protect the backside any better than the original back cover. The silicone back cover also helps the front to stay closed better. The Qi charger works great with the thin silicone cover on. I took inside pictures at our Christmas party and the pictures were awesome. I used HDR mode and everyone looked great. I usually just keep the HDR in auto or turn it off for action shots. The camera is taking better pictures than my old (nice not cheap) digital camera. So now I only have one thing to carry around. The camera ""quick on and take a picture"" is a fun feature when the action is right now. Like when someone is skiing by and I don't have time to mess with a bunch of buttons. I could not see the screen very well out on the white glary mountain. So quick phone and quick answer features were helpful. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone that wants a larger phone and camera in one great package.Update: Just discovered the adjustable blur feature on the selfie camera. (I think it just downloaded) It's adjusted so that no one (not even teens) have red spots on their faces, yet the picture is very clear and bright. Everyone wants to take their selfie with this camera. It is really fun to fill in my phone book with nice looking close up photos of all my friends.Took a picture of the horizon on top of a snow covered hill. It is magazine beautiful with yellow sun rays, snow tipped trees and details when zooming in on the picture that I could not even see when taking the picture. This phone just gets better and better!

I used to be an Apple fan, so I list some comparison to iOS devices:1. Gesture typing : when you move along the keyboard the whole word with space will be typed for you, It's incrediblely convenient and make typing incrediblely fast and easy.2. Keyboard : it's, like a computer, has number keys and most symbols upfront, and it's easier than computer that you don't need shift key but simply hold longer or tilt a bit instead. Also the cap lock locks to capitals even when you move from one section to another. Avoided all frustration on iOS.3. Cursor: unlike iOS for the frustration of putting your finger on right spot for copy paste and correction, this phone use cursor which is so easy to control.4. Printing: it automatically set my home printer as default so l can print right away.5. Google: it automatically connect to all my Google accounts.6. Native YouTube support avoid all limitation with YouTube on iOS.7. NFC seems more fully functional.8. Voice is more applicable in voice typing, searching, etc.9. Synch with Windows system as easy as a USB drive.10. Standard connection,I can charge it with Kindle USB cable.11. Google map is so much better than iOS map. But I also installed another map for real GPS to avoid using data. This is not as convenience as Nokia Windows phone.12. Open Android OS, can get Android latest release once it's released, I'm using Android 5 already. Also easy to write your own apps. This is an advantage over other Android phone such as Samsung Galaxy.Drawbacks(you can install or even write an app to fix them):1. No undo for typing so if you accidentally delete some typing you have to retype it. Fortunately above mentioned feature make typing so easy that this drawback is not as bad as it sounds to be.2. The build-in foreign language keyboard support is not as complete as iOS. Install an App if needed.3. apps are allowed to access sensitive data. Watch out app disclosure or install a security app.4. Synch with Mac book is not strait forward,I didn't try the available app, but use Windows PC to copy all file to external hard drive instead.5. While gmail seems perfect, other mail lack of search capability, I have to install an app for other mail. Don't know why Google can't fix it. Well, but iPhone iPad has even worse issue with some email carriers.This phone is brand new fast delivery, a lot of thanks to the seller.

But for some that might be worth that extra gold brick.The display on the vivo 5 is truly kick Ace! Who freaking needs 4k on a 5.5"" screen anyway, trust me you wont see the difference, nor will you miss your 1080 phone (I don't)(mine was Asus zencrap) .Thanks to the 3gb of ram, octa-core processor, and the 720p display the vivo's performance is pretty incredible. Yes, in a race with the s7 the vivo can hang! It's very very very snappy, fast even! Needless to say there are a few UI things that aren't really my taste but I'm getting used to them and that's true for the s7 too so I won't dock it for that.Overall this phone is blu's masterpiece and makes me smile just looking at this work of chinese/florida art!Update 05/06/2016 I loved my vivo 5 until right now as I just dropped it and now there are spider web cracks all across the screen.

After reading the reviews left by some of the buyers, there seems to be some confusion on what seller to buy it from. My phone, which is real, and came factory sealed, was bought from ""The Coos"". However, to my understanding, there is no one out there making fake edge phones. The phone is just too complex to duplicate. What might be happening is the phones could possibly be getting damaged during the shipping process. The phone is glass, so if the shipper isn't packaging it correctly, it could absolutely take on damage. This is why I recommend, that if you are planning on buying this phone from amazon, make sure amazon is the one fulfilling the order. I have had no problems at all when I order from a third party that allows amazon to fulfill the order. Also, it doesn't hurt to review the customer reviews on the actual seller as well.As far as the phone itself goes, it works perfectly. All the specs pretty much define what to expect from the phone. It's got the best screen in the world and the best camera. The glass finish makes it beautiful, but it's fingerprint prone and and extremely slippery. Other than that, I have no complaints.",5,2

326002,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910C 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone - Frost White (International Version),Samsung,"This phone is awesome. I had a Note 2 for three years, but years of use ended my favorite phone ever. If I had known I would like the Note 4 this much I would have gotten it when it first came out. A couple of things to know and remember. First, this is the last model of Note that allows you to add a microSD card for additional memory. Second, this phone also allows you to replace the battery. The Note 5 has a solid case, and much like the iPhone, doesn't allow adding memory or changing the battery. To be honest, the battery is not a big issue. The battery life on Note phones is epic. In three years I never once had to change my battery in my Note 2, and never had it die before the end of the night, and the Note 4 battery life is even better. I can go the entire day using it and get home with 50% battery life. If there is one drawback that I dislike it is the lack of a radio. My Note 2 had a built in FM radio that allowed me to listen to the televisions at the gym when I worked out, but this does not. If they ever add the radio transmitter back to these Note phones it will be perfect.",5,1

25993,Apple iPhone 5C 16GB 4G LTE Blue - T-Mobile,,"this phone is acting up on far too much for me to humor the idea that it is simply the software. I've blown off problems as small tweaks that will be fixed. The phone out of the box was clean. Dare I say it, perfect. Everything worked flawlessly- needless to say, I was a satisfied customer. Had I done a rating then it would've been a 5 star rating titled, ""Perfect phone for perfect price!"" Only days later I started to notice its sporadic tendency to play sound through the speaker. Headphone jack worked fine. Again, I blew it off as minor problems. I've now had the phone for 2 weeks and 2 days. Today I found the phone no longer is capable of playing music through speaker or jack, acting possessed as skips through songs if they're in a list at all. It continues to act strangely even on the multitask window, and I must close it. Only minutes ago I found that video recording does't work and have connected the dots: video recording stopped working. In fact, I just tested the outcome of clicking on a video I had and it said ""Operation could not be performed."" I'm going to try to reset (although I'll resent the effort needed for it) and hopefully that fixes. Maybe it'll change my opinion. On the other hand, everything else works fine, although messages acts up every once in awhile for a couple minutes. Also, a receipt was not included in my box. So if you have other options, I would strongly encourage those. The extra 50$ spent may mean 2 years of hassle free cooperation from what should be a great product. I'll change (or post another) review if thinks begin to develop for the better. If not I will contact Amazon for help.",3,1

Phone streams MLB.TV on the LTE network with no issues which was one of the main things I was hoping for.

The screen is very vibrant and looks amazing.Cons: Like to pocket dial a lot but I heard Android is famous for that with emergency calling. No Camera button on the sides, I was very accustomed to it on my Nokia Lumia 925. Only 2 pages for shortcuts to apps, not sure if that is able to be changed or not. The double tap screen isn't as responsive as my wife's Sony Xperia.

192563,HTC One M7 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Cell Phone - Black,HTC,"This phone has been fantastic. I upgraded from the original Samsung Galaxy, and definitely wanted to get away from Samsung. My old Galaxy seemed to be exemplary of what you get from Samsung - a product that is initially great but quickly begins to slow down and wear out. My guess is that Samsung uses a lot of cheaper components in their phones, which makes them cheaper to manufacture and to satisfy demands. That might be great for the customer who wants to turn over their phone every year or so, but I like to stick with my tech for a while, at least until something significantly better comes around.Overall I love this phone, and have been using it for several months now. I guess I'll describe the features of the phone in a bit more detail below. As of right now, I can't name any specific complaints with the phone.===Aesthetics===This phone is gorgeous. I wasn't sure how I would adapt to having such a huge screen, but I can now say that it was really easy to get used to it. The screen is ample and the resolution and color fidelity is impressive. The aluminum body gives the whole phone a feeling that makes you recognize just how care and thought went into the design and fabrication of the phone. It also matches my MacBook Pro really well, which is just a fun little bonus for me.I couldn't bring myself to put a case on my phone. I'm a very careful person, especially with things of high value like a smartphone, so I think I'll be okay. After a few months of regular usage there are little to no scratches on the body, and I still get to enjoy having all my friends drool over the phone when I take it out.===Speakers===Probably the first thing that just really impressed me about the phone was the very loud and nice sounding speakers. I'm very picky about sound and audio quality, so I'm not comparing them to the great sound you get from things like Swan, Klipsch, etc. That being said, these speakers hold their own compared to built-in laptop speakers and blow other phones out of the water. It's really nice for watching videos and listening to music when you don't have a dedicated speaker to connect your phone to.Keep in mind though, the speakers are LOUD but they can't really compete with ambient noise. To get the most out of listening to the speakers you will need to be in a relatively quiet place that has some decent acoustics so the sound can resonate a bit. For example, they sound great in my bedroom which is a relatively small 11'x10' room but the overall effect diminishes when I play them outside in the courtyard or lawn. This, of course, is to be expected with any sound system so you can't really complain.===Camera===I was really excited about the camera for taking low-light pictures in concerts. The first time I tried it though, the camera just totally failed to produce any good images. I know quite a bit about photography, so it seemed to me that the software was trying to compensate for the average low-light by really blowing out the ISO. This would normally work to produce a terribly quality picture that is nonetheless, in focus. Unfortunately, since concerts are generally a blend of extreme darkness off-stage, and VERY bright lights on-stage, this ends up blowing out the stage and the phone can't figure out what to focus on. I basically got a lot of blurry pictures of what looks like glowing humanoids in a dark room.I was pretty disappointed with the results, especially after comparing photos with my friend's iPhone 4. Knowing the specs of the camera, I feel that this is largely a software issue, and frankly if I had full control over ISO, shutter speed, and aperture I could probably get this to take great pictures.While there isn't a way to control shutter speed and aperture as far as I can tell, you can control the ISO. So the next concert I went to, I capped the ISO at 100 and voila! The camera was able to distinguish the band, and take really pretty good pictures.After figuring out what I needed to tinker with to get good pictures, the camera's other software and features really started to shine. The continuous shooting option allows you to take a burst of images and select the best one, which was great for capturing dynamic moments on stage. Another feature I've come to love is the panorama shot (outside of concert-photography of course) and the Zoe.I originally thought the Zoe was kind of a dumb gimmicky thing, and part of me still does believe that. However, it is really kind of cool to have you gallery of events on your phone, complete with little mini-movies that just makes it easy to feel like you are relieving the moment. Sadly, there are no good ways of getting these files off your phone.There's a lot of other great tricks as well, which I haven't fully explored. If you're interested there's lots of articles out there on getting the most out of the HTC One's camera, I'd recommend giving them a look.===Performance===Really not much to say here besides the fact that the One is just blazing fast. It's fast at everything it does. The only time it isn't fast it's because the data connection is crap, but that happens rarely in Boston.===Blinkfeed===I kind of thought I wouldn't like this unremovable feature that comes with the One. I definitely changed my homescreen, but I often find mysel fusing Blinkfeed. I'm really, really, really, busy. I'm sure a lot of you are also really busy. For me, at least, this has translated to me being pretty far removed from what's going on in the rest of the world. That's where blinkfeed comes in to provide me with something I didn't have super easy access to before - news! It's all right there, constantly updating a feed of news based on what you're interested in. It's like having an electronic newspaper on hand all the time. For that reason, I've really loved it.That's about it in terms of the features that immediately come to mind. Hopefully you've found this review helpful. If you're torn between getting the One of the Samsung, I would really recommend the One. I have owned many Samsung products over the years, and have had many friends with their products as well. Overall, they just don't seem to last very long. I feel that Samsung is just under the impression that its customers won't be keeping their products for much longer than a year, so they don't build them to last much longer than that.If you want a solidly constructed Android phone that will both last you a long time and offer you everything you could want from the top smartphones on the market today, this is your guy.",5,12

It arrived in almost mint condition, came with everything listed. Wall charger, usb plug, and manual booklet. However there are some things I had to get used to a bit and one of them being the power button in the back of the phone. It took a bit of getting used to since all Samsung phones that I've purchased have had the power button on the side. Also on the LG g2 you have the option of tapping the middle of the phone to turn it on or you can use the power button in the back, and sometimes I would keep it in my pocket and it would turn on and butt dial someone by accident so I turned that feature off. The phone is also super sensitive to touch. However the phone itself is just phenomenal. The battery last 2 days without charging it. The camera quality is Crystal clear.

I will do my update first. I have had the phone for about 2 months now and the phone is still as beautiful as the first day I bought it. The only issue is there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT FOR IT! I knew it was a phone not really available in the US but I had seen a US support phone number for it. Well it turns out that number does not support the Mediapad. Why do I need support? I have had a few issues. A lot of play store apps don't work on the phone well. They will download, they will open, they will even work for a day. But then the next day they turn off. To get the to work you have to open each app every day. A little tedious.1. I have tried at least 20 ""alarm timer/ reminder"" apps and they all work fine for a day. Then they turn off.2. I like having a call recorder on my phone so I don't have to take notes during a phone call, or if I forget a number someone tells me. I have tried at least 12, they all work fine for a day!3. I have tried a bunch of other apps that need day to day operation and they don't continue to work.AND THERE IS NO SUPPORT! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.If there is anybody out there that knows a fix, please let me know. I do like the phone, but I don't know if I will keep it. You can read my initial review below.Well I just received my Mediapad yesterday and what is there to say. I love it! At first glance, yes it is large, it feels quality, I like it. The first thing I noticed is that all of the two buttons on the device are on the right side. I am used to the volume rocker being on the left side so this will take a little getting used to. As I held it in my hand I think I understand the thinking behind the button arrangement. Since it is so large you would need a very big hand to be able to reach both sides of the unit to operate the buttons. With both on the same side you operate both of them with your thumb.So having it in my hand I turned it on to find the most beautiful screen I have ever seen on a phone. Large, bright, colorful, clear yada yada... At this point I headed to the T-Mobile store which was rather uneventful, being Verizon for the past 15 years I am looking forward to a change.So far it has just been 24 hours and have used the phone a dozen times and loaded a bunch of apps. So far everything is going good.I will post more as time goes along. Let me know if you have any questions.",5,32

The screen protector is really thick, and I removed it using the screen cover I had on it. There seems to be issues with the buttons on the case... I put it away in my bag, and found it discharged completely because the buttons were pressed or something, that made it turn on while stored. The buttons seem to have a hard to press feel and a space in between the case buttons and the tablet buttons, that may be an issue later. Others have said the buttons break or damage the unit. The ""stand"" is only partially decent. I expected it to be better built and attached to the back of the case... it is a separate piece that you stand the unit up in, and doesn't spin, or accommodate portrait viewing very well. it acts as a screen cover when not in use, and that's the best feature of the ""stand"" I can see.

It has most of the bells and whistles much more expensive phones have but for fraction of their price. Also, it has the latest Sense 3.5 layered over Android 2.3.5. User interface is therefore first class. You will learn how to use it in no time.There's a lot of applications built in: web browser, navigation, social networking, Google search, address book with deep integration with all your contacts across various media, audio and video players and recorders, Android market, calendar and organizer, e-mail clients, etc.Connectivity is brilliant: Bluetooth 3.0, GPS, several modes for connecting to your PC, Wi-Fi, micro USB. GSM connectivity covers most bands: quad-band 2G and dual-band 3G. Also, the phone is fully unlocked, unbranded, SIM-free; you can check the software information to prove that (software revision/build number is *.401.*).Build quality is surprisingly good for this price range, mixture of aluminum and rubberized body give a sense of holding much more expensive device in your hand. Battery life could definitely be better, but it's not a deal-breaker.The response is snappy, considering the hardware inside. Screen is very good and clear, and covers almost whole front face of the phone. Camera is of modest quality. Audio quality is good. Video playback is limited, but this is not what this phone is really made for. Memory is big enough for several additional applications/gadgets and there's a microSD slot if you need more space.To summarize - there are definitely better phones out there. But not for this price. All in all, this was one of my best investments ever (and I have much more expensive phones to compare it with). Highly recommended.",5,22

The first was a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, phone version. Which was only available in China, and which I had shipped in.Prior to a seven inch phone I had been using the opposite extreme. I was using an Omate Trusmart which is an Android based watch phone. I liked the tiny screen, and enjoyed the fact that while others had smart watches, no one else I knew had a smart watch that was not dependent on another device, and that was a fully functional Android device.Then my eyes went to pot.I am 38 years old. In the last year my eyes have gone from seeing small print well, to not seeing well in low light, to now, where I have to hold things way back and really try to focus.Being a lover of tech, and someone who researches until he finds the perfect niche device for my needs, I found the previously mentioned seven inch phone by Samsung, which was not available in the States. Used it and loved it, but it had limitations. This device by Huawei addresses all the limitations of my former giant phone.Namely, it has a great camera, (which the Samsung device did not), it has amazing battery life, it has 32 GB of storage, and it has all standard sensors, including an accelerator, compass, low light sensor, etc.As mentioned, I am a tech geek. I purchase a lot of devices. I currently own the latest iPhone (iPhone 6 Plus) the latest kindle, the latest Microsoft Surface Pro, the latest Apple Macbook, and about ten other devices.Right now, this particular device is my favorite. I have stated this before about other devices, and as technology advances, I will not doubt say it again in the future. But currently this is hands down the coolest device I own.It fits in my pocket, has battery life to last two days, is powerful enough to handle virtually all my computing needs, has a great camera, and a pretty impressive launcher. Not to mention a sexy look and feel, and a bright / intense screen that looks awesome.With this device I have everything I need to do business, church, home, play, always in my pocket. As well as answer calls, and surf the net.Best of all, my old man eyes can see the screen without issue.--Last thing I will add is regarding the magnetic cover. It is just down right cool! Look up a video on YouTube showing this feature off. The cover has a small window in it, that allows you to use the camera without opening it, as well as answer calls through the screen. This feature alone is a killer feature that makes it cooler than anything else I currently have in my tech arsenal.",5,55

I'm still conflicted on whether I like it better than I did with my OnePlus One. The ASUS ZenUI has really come a long way with the value added software that they include on top of Android OS. It comes with a complete security software suite that I've used (CM Security) and several other useful apps preloaded (that you can remove as needed). It doesn't have as much bloat as the older Asus Android products I've owned.Charging performance is pretty good, although sometimes I have an issue with certain power adapters on this phone.I really don't like that it still runs Android 5.0 though, that is part of the reason it has only 4 stars on this review. I wish they would come out with the 6.0 ROM release for this phone already. It's been promised for a while, but it hasn't come out yet. The 5.0 version of Android is plagued with OS bugs that cause the battery to drain quickly sometimes and I've noticed that a time or two on this phone. Some days it works better than others as far as battery life (with similar usage patterns). They do include some pretty good battery management programs like a memory/battery life booster app that cleans up unused memory and background apps. There is also an auto-start manager app that lets you deny most apps from starting up with the phone so they aren't constantly running in the background chewing up CPU cycles and draining the phone quicker.I want to love this phone more than I do, even though it's a great phone and I have to say I'm more impressed with this one than my Asus Transformer Prime T700 tablet that I have. But the battery life issue is sort of a pain as well as not having the latest OS. I also miss Cyanogenmod and all the customization that comes with that.Most likely what will happen is as soon as it looses it's warranty life I'm going to unlock the bootloader, root the phone, and install a custom CM13 (or CM14 whatever is stable at that time) on here...UPDATE: After 4 months of ownership the phone won't charge fully and it has issues with connecting to my PC or Mac it shows device not recognized even though I've tried several different drivers including the ones that Asus recommends on their support website. I can leave it at the charging screen (when you first power on/not in the OS) and it still takes 8-10 hours to charge the battery full. So I think there is something wrong with the usb/charging port. The battery life on here is getting worse too. So i'm hoping I just got a lemon design and they will replace it with a working one. For now, moving my review down to 3 stars. :(",3,2
274258,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,"This is one of the best phones that I have used in a while. It has a nice weight to it that makes it feel very secure in my hands, which is a huge plus. I'm known for destroying my phones on concrete and legdes and stuff of that nature. I love the Windows Os system. It makes navigation extremely easy, just make sure that you download the ""Here Drive +"" app before you make any trips. I was going to a party, and didn't have it downloaded, and could not get directions. But the only thing I would have a problem with, would be the battery life. It's pretty short. One way to optimize the use of battery make sure everything is turned off, and put the battery save on. you'll get about 2 and a half days on stand by and about 10 using apps. Other than that, that's it. Overall AMAZING phone, I would recommend it to anyone looking to be different, or a change in Os systems.",5,1

DO NOT use the Ovi Suite software if you need to sync your Outlook data - it has a nasty habit of overwriting your Outlook data file. If you are lucky, it will just create a mess. If you are unlucky - well, I hope you backed up your data lately. Much less problematic is Nokia's PC Suite - it is the predecessor to Ovi Suit. It too has problems (I could only get it to sync 30 contacts at a time) but it is much less buggy. The down side to PC Suite is that Nokia is abandoning its support/updates for this software.

390529,Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Black (US Warranty),Sony,"This is by no means a perfect phone but this is really the best you can get for a small android phone. Almost all the phone manufacturers have dismissed making a small phone in favor of their 5+ inch slabs. I started using androids with a Moto X 2013, which to me was the perfect 4.7 inch phone if you disregard the crappy camera that it had. Unfortunately, Motorola decided bigger is better with their later models, and now the their Chinese overlords that currently own them have pretty much stated that they have no plans of making a small phone again. In fact, they have gone full retard with them making their current phones even bigger and wider.After the Moto X started slowing down after a few drops and age, I ""upgraded"" to the new Moto G 2015, which was not too bad in terms of screen height at 5 inches, but the width of this tubby made it hard to handle with one hand. Not to mention that is was a downgrade from the beautiful AMOLED screen from the Moto X. My camera and LED light crapped out after I dropped my Moto G so I got the Xperia X Compact after some research.Now the nice things about this phone:- Screen: I'm not much of a high res snob but 720p works for this size and it looks much better than my Moto G which had that resolution for 5 inches. Just wish this was an AMOLED for those nice dark blacks.- Memory: I've felt no slowdowns as far as RAM when multitasking. For regular storage you have 32GB which is enough for most people but you can also expand it 256 GB more with a micro SD.- Camera: Best camera that I've had which is not saying much given what my previous phones are. Other people would probably be more credible than me since I never but too much importance on this function but these pictures do look sweet.- Speed: Feels a hell of a lot snappier than my previous phone which is really no surprise with the superior processor. Apparently, the lower resolution gives it a faster speed than say a 1080p would.- Button placement: Yes, I actually like where the sound buttons are placed. I use my phones left handed (even though I'm right handed) and the button placement for volume is actually not awkward as it would be for a right handed user. This doubles as a convenient zoom in and out button for the camera.- Double front facing speakers: A rarity these days, especially for this phone size. Very high quality audio too.-Battery life: About 40-60% at the end of a day which is pretty good for me but this will depend on the person and what apps they are using.Not so great things:- Exterior design: Could have used a more matte, less slippery design. Shows fingerprints. All this can be fixed with a skin but this should not have been necessary. Ergonomics are inferior to the curved Motorola and Samsung designs for handling, while this did improve from the previous blocky Sony phones by curving the sides, they could have done better.Price: This isn't too bad now that Sony has put down the crack pipe and lowered the price from their initial 500 dollar tag.Neutral things:- Lack of fingerprint scanner: This can actually be enabled by reflashing to the UK version which is what I did. Does appear to show less bars on reception as mentioned by a previous reviewer but the connection seems to work just fine. Would not recommend doing this for everyone but do it at your own risk or just buy the international version.-No waterproofing: More accurately, this is not warrantied as being waterproof. YouTube videos have shown that this is actually pretty water resistant and that Sony most likely just doesn't want to cover claims.Say what you will about Sony, while they are deserving of much criticism for their reported crappy customer service and overpricing of their phones, they are the only ones in the android market that are meeting a neglected segment by making a decent phone that is easy to handle one handed, that has a near stock android feel, and actually has the back and recent keys on the correct sides (looking at you Samsung).Note: Still in early ownership and will update if there are any snags.",4,11

Spot's rebate instructions clearly state the original UPC must be submitted so I have some concern I will ever see the rebate. If you are not familiar with a satellite phone you should be aware that quite a bit of open sky is required to get a signal, much more than is required for GPS or XM radio. But here's the kicker, reason I rated it so low: The phone has its outgoing caller ID blocked, so, for example, when I call my own home phone number, I get the message ""the party you have called does not accept calls from phones that have caller ID blocked"" and the call does not go through. I verified this ""feature"" with Spot customer service. They said they were aware of it and were working with the carrier (Globalstar) to get it removed, but could offer no timeline for when anything might happen. So here is a phone that would presumably be of use to reach out for help, search and rescue, etc., that is in ""Secret Agent"" mode and may very likely not connect with a number you may dearly want to reach. Ridiculous.",2,1
82039,"ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe 5.5-inch 4GB RAM, 64GB storage Unlocked Dual SIM Cell Phone, US Warranty (ZS550KL-Glacier Silver)",,"This is an outstanding phone despite the update issues I've had. The screen is sharp and clear even in sunlight. I even light the ZenUI! It has not overheated yet and the fit and finish are superb. This has been said before, but this truly looks like a more expensive phone. The camera with Laser focus is super fast and takes remarkably good pics. Granted, I'm not a photo aficionado not expert, but for the average user I think it will not disappoint. Accessories are still coming out, but you can find a cover easy enough. Just be sure to use the model number when looking as there are multiple models with similar specs.The Con:After updating the firmware to ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser ZC551KL (Z01B) software Image: WW_V11.40.53.17, my phone no longer will make/receive phone calls. Mobile internet/MMS/SMS work just great tho. ASUS was prompt in diagnosing faulty hardware and I am getting a replacement. Could happen with any product, my point is that support was prompt and professional.Update: 14 Nov - Two firmware updates later and the phone hasn't skipped a beat. Asus tech support think that it was a corrupted download that caused the issue previously. The phone has great camera features that I've been playing with. There are modes like HDR Pro, Beautification, Super Resolution, Children, Low Light, Night, Depth of Field, GIF Animation, and Smart Remove among others",5,7

102706,"Blackberry Z30 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black",BlackBerry,"This is an outstanding device! I broke the screen on my black Z30 & decided to replace the entire device with the white one. It's looks amazing, and I've been getting a LOT of attention! No one believes me, at first, when I say it's a BlackBerry. The screen is stunningly vivid and realistic. It actually looks like something printed on paper!The new BlackBerry 10 OS (particularly after 10.2.1 released) is ahead of iOS, Android, & Windows. It is very fast & fluid, extremely intuitive (I tried a Nokia Lumia w/Windows as backup & hated it!), and has a ton of functionality that aren't found on many devices- especially iPhones! Here are a few examples of what the Z30 have to offer:- 5"" Super AMOLED screen (beautiful!)- FM radio built in (helps to save on data)- USB On the Go (OTG) - connect USB peripherals, including a thumb drive, keyboard & mouse, etc. Allows laptop like use!- Miricast - Ability to wirelessly mirror device screen on an HDTV! If the TV doesn't support miricast, there are small adaptors that can be used- Wifi Direct - Allows 2 supported devices to communicate, transfer files, etc. when there's no Wifi network.- NFD communication - Allows 2 supported devices to initiate connections by tapping devices together- Toast notifications (can reply to some!) - Allows you to see messages as a pop up as they come in!- Best browser in the mobile world- Best keyboard in the mobile world, and the predictive text with ability to swipe is AMAZING- BlackBerry HUB - Keep track of ALL of your messages from ONE place without having to open a GAZILLION apps! I have 5 email accounts, BBM, FourSquare, WhatsAp, SMS, Facebook, Twitter, & LinkedIn all in the HUB. I can see, reply, create without having to OPEN 12 different applications to stay up to date!BlackBerry finally hit one out of the park! The problem is that not enough people know about this great device. I do hope that changes sometime soon. If you're willing to give it a try, you won't be disappointed! I'm completely happy with my purchase, and I believe you will be too!PS - This Z30 is model number STA100-2. It gets 4G in the US on AT&T. I've seen others answer that this is the -5 model.

188144,HTC Desire Eye E1 16GB White/Red. GSM Unlocked. US Version (13MP Front & Rear Camera),HTC,"This is an AT&T phone with less than 8gigs of storage.

This would be fine if the phone allowed apps to completely store on the external sd card, but that's not the case. Many apps are denied permission to write on the external card at all, so other than music, movies and pictures that do store on the ext sd card, this really is a phone with less than 8gigs. So i need to uninstall big apps before updating others. It's crazy.Other than that, the phone is a typical android. Nothing special or awful. The Camera is a little overated, but it is good. The selfie camera is obviously way better than most phones. If you go places with just you and your kids, this works out.

384731,Samsung T959 Galaxy S Vibrant 4G GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone,Samsung,"This is an amazing phone! I purchased this to replace my Blackberry 9700 because it was starting to act crazy. It got to the point where the phone would freeze when a call came through only to unfreeze when the caller hung up. Finally fed up I chose to get this device. Originally I was not interested in this phone because I was still scarred from the G1 experience and wanted nothing more to do with Android. After my friends found out I was intensely looking into the HTC HD7 they worked diligently to change my mind and steer me back to Android. This smartphone does everything and more. I will be as detailed as possible about this device.PackagingWhen I received the package I found that it was very well put together. The box, of course, was open because the dealer needed to remove the sim card and to unlock the phone. Otherwise the phone was pristine and looked like I had ordered it from Tmobile. The items that were included was the phone, travel charger extender, data wire, battery, 16 GB micro sd card, Samsung premium in-ear earphones, and the manuals. One thing I did not like about the charger was that there is not a wire attached to the travel portion so you have to always use the data cable to charge the phone. This looks like it's the norm for this line of phones, so no quality loss on behalf of the dealer, just simply Samsung's poor designing. The back of the phone is a little flimsier than I would like, but that's all opinion. The weight of the phone is not heavy at all but is so sturdy that one would think that a metal back would make it a little classier. I have the Samsung Behold as well, much cheaper than this phone, and it has a really nice metal-like back on it. Overall, however, the packaging was very professional.ScreenThe screen on the phone is a four inch super amoled screen. The colors are very vibrant and crisp with no visible pixelation.NetworkI have Tmobile unlimited prepaid service, which is $70 a month. I had absolutely no issues in getting service started. I live in an area where my blackberry constantly stayed between edge and 3G, never fully 3G service so I had no high hopes for this device. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I installed my sim that the indicator was telling me that I was on the 4G network. I have been on this network all day and it has not dropped bars and has remained a steady 4G so I am thrilled about that. The HSPA+ service definitely works and the connections are extremely fast. No issues in that department.Email SetupI had a little difficulty setting up my email addresses on the phone. I tried fruitlessly when I first turned the phone on to activate my yahoo accounts and the server kept stating that it was not available and could not process my request. I gave up for a few hours and tried again and it did connect. If email is important to you, it may be a slight headache to activate but will run smoothly when it's actually configured. I found that I needed to set up a gmail account in order to use the Marketplace. While it is not necessary to have a gmail account to access the OS upon first turning the phone on (like the G1), you should take into account that to use this feature you will have to create an account. I still have not synced my student email to the phone because it's asking for features I do not have (domain). In comparison the Blackberry 9700 allowed me to sync my school account with no issues and never asked for a domain. I just input the email address and password and off I went. This is a slight annoyance but not the end of the world.MessagingMessaging is pretty standard here. The setup and the color scheme makes it enticing to look at and operates beautifully. There are two keyboards on the phone: Swype and Samsung. I am not much on swyping because I kept making mistakes and that is slightly agitating. I changed the keyboard to Samsung standard and my headache of texting went away!Call LevelI found that there were no issues on the calls that I placed. I heard no static, the calls didn't drop and that's all one could ask for. This phone does support WiFi calls. I made a few calls on WiFi and also found no issues in the quality.BluetoothIt took me less than a minute to sync my Bluetooth with this phone. The phone found the device in about five seconds, found the password OTA and entered it for me and then connected. I was shocked at how fast and effortless it was.BrowserThe internet browser is really decent. I was able to go to every site that I attempted with no issues. This phone has adobe flash embedded in the browser so therefore you are able to view video's within various websites without the video's being attached to YouTube which is really nice.Battery LifeThe battery life on this phone is excellent, as far as I can tell. I charged the phone completely when I received it without turning it on to ensure that I did not destroy my battery power before I even got started. I don't know if that's a myth, but I charged first just in case it wasn't.Overall this is a nice device and definitely worth the amount of money it's listed for. I have been looking at and reviewing the specs for weeks now and I am glad that I made this choice. I would recommend this to anyone on the Tmobile network but I cannot definitively say that this works on other GSM carriers because I was not able to test other carriers. Minus the battery charger, the back cover, and email issues I give this device a 4.5/5.0!**Edit June 27, 2011**This phone has a really nice, crisp, vibrant display but one problem I have found is when sitting outside in the sunlight you almost cannot see what's on the screen. For this inconvenience I am dropping this review down to a 4.0. What is the point of having a mobile device if you cannot see the screen outside which is the primary purpose of a portable phone?Another issue I have stumbled on is that the ringtone does not always ring. There are times when I have notifications when I turn the screen on but I did not hear the tone go off. For this to be fixed you have to turn the phone off and back on. I don't know if that was just my device but that has annoyed me a little. The ringtones are also a little lower than I would like.I have been enjoying this device, but there are some issues one cannot overlook just because I like the phone. I still recommend it however if these issues are enough to agitate you then I would find something else.**Edit June 29, 2011**I never reviewed the video and music player because I had not tried them at the time of the original review. I typically don't use my phone other than for what it's intended for because I have a Zune HD which is music and video ad I like to keep media seperate from my phone because of the battery power usage however I wanted to see what else this phone could do. I have .avi movies on my computer so I decided to sync some to the phone to see what the quality really looked like. I was blown away at how crisp the screen was! When listening to the movies through earphones you have the ability to listen in 5.1 surround sound and it sounds like you are in the movie theater. I really enjoyed this feature. The mp3 player was delightful as well. I listened to an entire 12 song album and viewed a 1 hour 50 minute movie on this phone without being plugged to the charger and my battery never dropped power bars. I am thrilled with the battery life in this respect and that the media on the phone does not drain it. Very nice experience!**Edit July 5, 2011**I took a mini trip for the 4th of July to an area in my state that normally has decent coverage on T-Mobile's network. I ran into a lot of problems with this phone when I got into this area because the phone is provisioned for HSPA+ and this area is Edge/3G, more Edge than 3G. When I tried to use my phone I continuously got dropped calls or my calls would not complete and I am not going to get started on the net service out there. Because of the phone constantly looking for a 4G connection it sucked my battery down rather quickly and my phone just wasn't working. I am glad that this was just a getaway and not where I live, however, it is imperative that if you are considering this phone that you go to [...]and check the coverage very carefully because if you are not in a 4G area there is a great chance that you will assume that the phone bites when in actuality it's the coverage, not the phone. I am not too sure about the AT&T customers and how they may fare with this issue because I do not have an AT&T sim, but I would send my advice their way also. Check the coverage at AT&T if you have that service because your sim will be hitting their cell sites.**Edit July 9, 2011** Wireless TetheringI know this is a lot of updates, but I am still finding new options on this phone. So, I was in the Android Marketplace wanting to find a tethering service for this phone because my Blackberry 9700 had a tethering service named Tether and it was great and useful while I was at work. I found the same app in the marketplace and attempted to download it. Much to my annoyance and dismay it was not easy to set up. I had to download something called Samsung New PC Suite which allowed you to install the device on the computer and sync music and video's to the phone. While playing around with my settings I found that I was able to plug my phone into the computer with the PC Suite, activate tethering on the phone, and connect to the internet! I was not on my wifi at the time and I was confused because my pages were still loading on my computer. I did not have to download any 3rd party tethering program (and pay for it) because this phone has a built in tethering program and no, I did not have to pay extra for that feature on the phone. Here are the steps to activating the wireless feature:1. Download Samsung New PC Suite (preferrably an updated version) and install the program.2. Plug the phone into the computer and wait for the drivers to install, in which case you should receive the popup in the bottom right tray that says that everything installed and you should be able to use the phone.3. On your phone, hit the backspace key if you have a screen giving you three options which are for the Kies Firmware Update, Mass Storage, etc. After you hit the backspace key you should be back to the main screen on your phone.4. Hit ""Applications"" and scroll over to ""Settings"". Click on ""Settings"".5. Tap ""Wireless and Network"", then tap ""Tethering"".6. You should have a ""USB tethering"" option. Tap this option so that a checkmark is in the box. In your task bar at the top of the phone, you should see tethering enabled. You can hit the house to go back to the main screen on the phone.7. If your computer is Windows 7 and configured like mines you should see a little mini computer in the task bar next to the time. This will tell you that the connection is active. If it has a yellow bar next to it give it a few moments to connect to the internet. At this point you can surf the web! No extra money to put out, no gimmick, just internet.I am super glad that I was able to figure this out because I downloaded a trial and did not pay for the app but once I figured out how to get the app installed on the computer I was going to pay for the full app which was, like, $32 dollars. That's a lot to pay for a feature you already have for free, in my opinion. If you run into any issues trying to install this then there are support forums that will walk you through the issues. I cannot say that this is the same process on Vista or before because all of my pc's have been updated to 7. As far as AT&T I cannot say if they allow this connection because I also have no AT&T access but it is definitely worth a try. I think that this is a great feature and I thank Samsung for caring enough to add this, and for Tmobile not blocking my connection, because it's a lifesaver when not around a connection or a hotspot but have school work or something that must get done.**Edit July 24, 2011** Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh BatteryOn the 1620 mAh battery that comes with the phone I was ultimately able to squeeze out 11 hours of usage, from 9:45 a.m to 8:00 p.m, on heavy use. The problem I ran into was that I actually leave my job at 10 p.m, sometimes a smidgen later, and I was not thrilled with having a dead phone to go home with. With that, I chose to get the Seidio Innocell 3000 mAh battery from amazon. I received this battery on Friday afternoon. Charged it from 7:30 p.m to 2:00 a.m Saturday morning. I used this phone from 2:00 a.m until 4:00 a.m Sunday and my phone was still at 4%. This is after over 3 hours of conversation, non-stop messaging, Facebook messages and status updates, internet, YouTube video's for 30 minutes, gaming and using the OI Shopping app when I got off work at midnight and picked up a few things for Sunday dinner at Wal-Mart. Calculate the time: From 2:00 a.m Saturday til 4:00 a.m Sunday I did not touch my charger. I took my charger to work with me just in case and never pulled it out of my purse. That is 26 straight hours of power, and then some because when I went to bed at 4 a.m my phone was at 4% and I could not kill the battery and trust me I did everything I could to kill it because I am still conditioning the battery and wanted to charge it from slam dead. However, I gave in and charged it at 4%. There is no telling how long that battery truly lasts beyond 4% because I had to give up and go to bed and I needed a working phone later in the day and did not want to chance standby and a dead phone when I woke up 8 hours later. Nonetheless, this is an accessory that is really necessary if you are like me and enjoy having the phone all day! This battery is $56.00 here on amazon.com and it's worth every penny! (I did a more detailed review on the battery page and like the phone journey I will be updating that review as I get more of an understanding of what it will be doing over time, especially next weekend when I am done conditioning it.)**Edit August 14, 2011**Less than 2 months after getting this phone it has begun to freeze on me and shut off in the middle of the calls. The dialer is forcing close as well. This was my main issue with the G1 when I had it a few years ago. It forced closed so many times that I was forced to get another phone. I have not found the reason for the freezing and shut off but it has disconnected my calls at least three times this week and re-booted as well as the calls will mysteriously drop with full signal. I am not going to throw in the towel just yet. I will do a little googling and see if maybe this phone is due for an update but if this issue is not fixed soon I will be forced to get another device, which I really do not want to do at this point. For these new issues, I am going to drop this to a three star rating and raise it back to four if I can fix it.**Edit Auguest 17, 2011** Roots and Mobile Access Points, Oh My!Okay, a few days ago I have been having issues with my phone cutting off in the middle of conversations and dropping calls on full 4G signal strength. I went through my settings and realized that I was a ""Super User"". Now, I know that having a ""rooted"" phone does not mean that it will cause the phone to power cycle or drop connection, however, ever since I ""unrooted"" this device I have not had any additional issues with it powering off or dropping calls. For those who don't understand what rooting is, this is a process very similar to taking over administrative rights to your computer, only it's taking over ownership of your phone which allows you to download and install third party applications. The phones from this dealer are rooted and unlocked, so that's something to consider if you start having issues similar to what I experienced.I also just found out that this phone is a wireless access point, which allows you to wirelessly share your data connection through the phone company with up to five additional wireless devices. I tried this last night with my Zune HD and my laptop and it works beautifully. To enable this feature:1. Go to Settings2. Go to Wireless and Network3. Go to Mobile AP (3rd Option)4. Select Mobile AP (1st Option; option will not be active if battery dips below a certain point)5. Activate Wifi on the device you want to use and look for the network, usually named ""Android"" with some numbers after the name.I cannot definitively say that this actually work for carriers other than Tmobile, because I have no other sim cards to test, but it's always worth a shot! Remember that Mobile AP is a hotspot but that it also uses your data so make sure you have unlimited if you plan on using this option a lot. Tmobile has no more than 5GB of data, which is rumored to be unlimited but I don't know because I am somewhat midway through the month and I have used over 2GB of data, so we will see at the end of the month if it is, indeed, unlimited.",4,123

Also, volume is not as strongOnly runs HSPDA+ for AT&T instead of LTE (in America). I doubt most people could tell the difference unless you really need that throughput.Power button takes a little more effort to push (actually may be an advantage to avoid turning on/off the phone too easy)Documentation is minimal, but sufficient.Overall, great phone worth the $350 I paid for it.

It has a great battery life and is running the newest version of Android (Kitkat 4.4.3 at the time of this writing). Also, sound quality is very good. As you might know, the camera... sucks. It does alright if you only need it occasionally. The hardest part is that it has no auto zoom so it's really hard to focus on QR codes and you can forget about depositing checks via mobile banking. Also, the internal memory is pretty small, so you're going to need an SD card, but I already had one, so it was no extra cost. The reason I give this 5 stars is because of the value. It is a very good running phone for a decent price. All I want is a simple smartphone that will runs simple apps and data very well, without paying for a fancy camera or other feature that you don't really need. That's exactly what I got.Ok, so I've had this phone for several months now. As I've downloaded more apps, it has slowed down somewhat. It still functions pretty well, but there is a little bit more of a lag. Noticeable but doesn't detract to much from the functionality.

265604,Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black),Nokia,"This is a review of a Nokia E72.Disappointed. Would not recommend.Stability -- Terrible. Applications crash or lock up frequently. My max uptime is less than one day. It is trivial to crash this phone. This is with the latest available firmware (as of 20099-12-13) and stock applications. Sometimes the crash is limit to just one app, other times it's the whole phone. Sometimes it locks up hard and the only way to recover is to remove the battery. I've had to pull the battery three times in five days.Sound quality -- The sound quality during calls is excellent. Plenty loud enough.Battery -- Battery life is excellent. I can go two days on a full charge compared with one day on my iphone. I'm impressed by the battery life.Web browser -- The built-in browser does not support tabs or multiple pages of any kind so you may spend a lot of time using the back button. The only real alternative to the built-in browse is Opera Mobile 10, which is in beta and has some significant bugs on the E72 (e.g. the ""u"" key types an asterisk, ""*"").Mail -- I use the phone with both an IMAP sever and an Exchange server. Both work well. I've encountered two flaws. One is with IMAP support. You have no control over where copies of sent message are stored. Unlike most IMAP clients you cannot choose the folder. The other flaw is mass delete. If you have many messages you wish to delete there are three options. Mark all messages in the folder and delete (deletes *all* messages in the folder), delete and confirm each message individually (two clicks per message), or mark each message you wish to delete and delete (requires *five* clicks per message).Tethering -- I'm impressed how easy it was to tether via USB. Works great with NetworkManager on Linux. No extra drivers needed. When phone asks, choose ""PC Suite"" mode.Overall -- It's a good phone when it works. However, it is so unreliable that I cannot recommend it to anyone. Is there hope in a newer firmware (when one is released)? Maybe. Unfortunately, the more I read and ask around, the more I heard that Nokia phones are not known for stability. I'm doubtful. It's pretty clear that Nokia is done with S60 and has moved on to the Maemo platform. Going forward I don't expect them to put much effort into the S60 software.",2,5

You can enhance some features by going through a UK proxy server, but that is quite a bit of work. If you travel to the UK and get a UK sim card, I would imagine all the toys and widgets can be downloaded there.With T-Mobile prepaid service MMS does work, once you get the settings correct (find on the net), but mobile web does not, except for T-Zones. Once you have MMS working, T-mobile will eventually push their preferred settings to you (It took them three weeks), but with the new settings, no change in performance was noted.With AT&T prepaid (GoPhone) service, MMS does not work (due to AT&T support problems, not the phone), but Mobile web does ( most of the time) - again once you find the correct settings on the net - forget about AT&T support.This is not a 3G phone - but it supports the 4 commonly used bands for Edge and voice services though, so it should work everywhere.As others have noted, the adapter is a euro plug with a US adapter - not a big deal.Also note that the calculator is set for UK settings - Imperial gallons - not US etc. The calendar is set for the Euro standard of Monday - Sunday (that was the 7th day wasn't it?), but you can change it to Sunday - Saturday.The camera shots for are a little fuzzy, so don't expect great pictures.All in all a good little compact phone that beats a candy bar phone.

When I received my phone, I was impressed. It had lots of nice features, it was nicely packaged, etc. It took some effort as I was never able to get the Verizon backup utility to work. Verizon's response is to make it a Verizon phone (this eliminates the advantages of buying an unlocked phone). So I had to get my old phone on, and export the contact list as a file, which I copied onto the phone. This worked. I was able to setup Google backup and that seems to work well. So, now to the BIG negative. 3 months in, I am noticing little glitches. The camera takes really good pictures, but it seems as though 8 out of 10 are corrupt. So this is no good. some apps seems to be slow. So I check the automatic update and it seems to set to work, but I decided to hit the check updates now on the operating system. Error message pops up saying the phone is not registered. So if you have an unlocked phone, this tells me I need to register it and it will work. So I headed over to LG's site to register, and every time I enter the phone data, I get an error saying my session has expired. So I cannot register this phone and I cannot get updates. The phone continues to act glitchy and I am considering dumping it and switching to the Google Nexus and their project Fi. So before you spend a lot of money on this phone, or any other, weigh in the fact that updating the Android operating system will be next to impossible if you are not a really experienced user.UPDATE: LG customer service responded to my request for support. They were polite but5in short, they do not care. It is up to the service provider to support the phone. So LG is a big fail in my book.I should note that all of the trouble started 45 days after I received the phone. So it's not eligible for return.",1,2

It is also fast and fluid and the battery lasts forever. The camera, though not a Galaxy-beater, is passable in bright settings.Yes, I got over the EMUI interface. I loaded Nova Launcher and life was good.But... There is a fatal flaw.Although the device has all the necessary LTE bands for use in America, and although it will upgrade (to a point) after you do your first upgrade using the OTA method, the device's ""location code"" automatically sets to ""International General"" after the first OTA upgrade. (Look for the C900 in the Firmware version number.) From there on out, the only way you can upgrade the device is to manually download a different regional ROM image, unlock the device, edit the config files deep inside the OS that control the region code, and then manually side-load the ALT-ROM. Since I must use a program that requires my phone to remain locked, I could not complete the process. Upgrading would have meant erasing my phone each time, and I cannot do that without incurring anger from our corporate IT team.Go in with your eyes wide open and you may be satisfied.

The phone is really slim and looks great. The only thing I did not like about this phone is the on screen buttons. I have big fingers, like a lot of guys.

Which is really well. I am a pretty picky person and I am extremely pleased with this.One more note, I connect it to a Power Mac with USB for music and photos. Sony has a ""Sony Bridge for Mac"" which is a little basic, but gets the job done nicely for moving pictures either direction (and is integrates with iPhoto library) and music into phone (and is integrated with iTunes library). Also, Sony has a ""find your phone"" app, which I really like...in case I leave it somewhere.Just a general note. It has several things that just work as expected - EVERY TIME. For example, it connects to my home wifi and turns off cell data, connects to my car blue tooth, updates apps only on wifi, etc., EVERY TIME. My last phone did these most times, but when you needed it the most, it would not work. Its so nice that the the Compact does not have any funky glitchy things that can really spoil the phone experience.Finally, I really like the size.

264395,"Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue)",Nokia,"This is a great phone as mentioned by others but with major shortcoming as well. I bought it for some very specific uses like the GPS, AMOLED display and HDMI output and for that it cant be beat. Although the phone is a little heavy it is not difficult to carry but it is noticeable because of the keyboard and metallic body. There is also no more updates so what you get is what you have to do with because installing apps is difficult and Microsoft makes sure all default links get broken. But the system that comes with it works just like android and I like it better although both work the same way pretty much. The first thing you have to do is charge it and then turn off everything pretty much because the battery only lasts for like 5 hours with default settings. With things like 3G and WiFi off you get like 3 days of use as a phone. I started turning on things one at a time until I got 2 days of use. And also the sleeping clock that is always ON like an LED display. No lockups and such. Maybe because I did not try to run many apps at the same time. It works exactly like android so anyone who's used a tab would find it all familiar. But since Microsoft killed all links and support many app functions are broken. New versions of whatsapp is still being done. But with broken links for so many apps you cant just use anything. Installing apps now is a long process but it can be done. Overall for the price and what I want to use it for, it cant be beat.. The GPS with AMOLED display is great while driving during the daytime. 8MP camera is not bad but its just for when you don't have anything else. HDMI output is great for presentations. And over all even with the problems I am happy.. The phone is heavy and the metal makes it slippery so you need a cover.. But it is not a burden.. And keep in mind the problems it does have. Not for gamers and such this is more like a business phone with a keyboard..",5,1

Smooth, Shiny and thinner than I expected. The build quality and materials are excellent, real metal and glass, no more plastic. I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active as my personal phone. The S6 Edge is sleek by comparison. I also have a Note 4 Edge from work and love the wrap around screen. The S6 fits my hand much easier than the Note 4, but either is great. I went with the unlocked phone primarily because I am tired of the constant contract renewals and pressure to ""rent"" their phone. Their sales pitch is all about low monthly payments. However they fail to point out that those payments go on seemingly forever and you don't really own the phone until you pay more than current retail value over the next 24-36 months. Second reason is the color - I know that's a bit shallow, but I want it to stand out from the rest of the phones out there. Last reason is occasionally I travel abroad for work. Finally nice to be able to use my own phone and not a throwaway.The only surprise was that the S6 Edge uses the NANO SIM size where my S4 was bigger. Couple of options to remedy this - Get an eXacto knife and cut it down freehand, Take it to your carrier and have them swap it out for a smaller size, or order a cutter on Amazon for under $10. I took option 3, knowing that if I broke it, I can always go to my carrier and get another SIM.",5,2

The device has a aluminum unibody design that feels and looks really premium.Overall I'd recommend it.If you are deciding whether to get this or the honor 5x then I say pick the vivo 5 if you don't need a fingerprint scanner. the 2x storage, extra ram, usb type c and super amoled display are the main reasons why I chose it. Do not let the on paper resolution difference worry you. On a 5.5 inch screen 720p looks sharp and the super amoled makes colors really pop and the blacks will actually look black and not the glowing blacks that ips displays have.

Be it GPS controlled navigation, be it realtime fuel measurement via OBD2/Bluetooth, taking pictures, voice controlled web browsing etc.Pros:- all bells and whistles: SIM, SD card, camera, all sensors, proportional QVGA display (320x240), FM radio- battery is replaceable (also identical to some other similar shaped watches)- good GPS reception makes it perfect for outdoor orientation (car navigation, geo caching etc)- full Android 4.x allows for basically any software installation and operation- can easily be rooted for even better functionality (apps to SD card, full backup, system tweaks etc)- very affordable compared to new smartwatches; i paid about $65 with two batteries.Cons:- plastic case/strap and overall build quality are rather simple and cheap, also quite bulky, 'not pretty'- the background light eats the battery alive, it can not be dimmed at all; use apps that control the display programmatically instead- battery capacity is measured incorrectly; use a VOLTAGE measurement app instead so you do not get surprised by sudden 'empty!' alarms- WLAN sensitivity is a little weak- the single core 1GHz processor and small memory space limits the number of parallel processes somewhat- overall runtime on one charge is just 2hr or so when the display is ON, otherwise it will run all day just fineI enjoy wearing this AN1 occasionally when on the road, instead of a smartphone.It works just as good, handles data traffic and notifications perfectly, it tells the time and everything else as well - what more could I ask for?!",4,4

240135,Microsoft Lumia 735 - Windows 8.1 Smartphone - Verizon + GSM Unlocked - Black (Certified Refurbished),Microsoft,"these refurbished phones have after market back plates on them (I have bought 2, from 2 separate orders, so I assume they are all the same) The back plates are a dark grey, not black, and are not the same as the new phones look, they are after market. They do not work on wireless qi chargers, which they are supposed to. They look like they would, but they are missing 2 of the square metal plates out of 4. So after receiving the second phone I thought it was my charger (which for sure works), or my software, or compatibility issues. I spent about 3 hours over two weeks trying to fix this, over the phone and at my carrier's store. what a pain in the rear. Finally I thought I would try a NEW, name brand replacement back cover from the original manufacturer, and that is what fixed the problem. I'm only mildly forgiving because the cover I bought was on sale (a lot), but the headache caused by these ""refurbished"" phones with faulty backs was seriously unappreciated. I saved $125 by getting refurbished, but what a pain. ",2,2
223175,"LG G4 H815 Factory Unlocked Cellphone, International Version No Warranty, 32GB, Brown Leather",LG,These phones are the absolute worst. The worst money I have ever spent. It lasted all of 9 months for something I paid Wireless Place almost 600 dollars. The unacceptable part is that the phones suffered from a manufacturers defect also called the boot loop issue which LG has claimed responsibility for via a loose component in the device. Imagine that within one year the manufacturers warranty doesn't cover a manufacturers defect. I bought my phone internationally unlocked so I could use it on my trips. Because it was bought internationally unlocked LG US claims it can't honor the manufacturers warranty. This is absolutely unfair from LG and Wireless Place. Wireless Place must be able to send back an item suffering from a manufacturers defect and have it either repaired to replaced. Never buy any LG especially from Wireless Place.,1,3

80345,"ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser Unlocked Smartphone, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage",ASUS Computers,"There's so much about this phone that I like, but it's definitely not perfect. This is the largest phone I've owned and while there was a learning curve to holding it, handling it quickly became second nature.I like the size of the screen and the clarity of the display. The location of the power/sleep button is fine, but having the volume rocker on the back is sometimes inconvenient.Coming from handsets that were in a class just below this, this phone is an overall upgrade from what I'm used to.The only issue I have is intermittent restarts. I haven't been able to pinpoint what causes it; the phone doesn't always seem hot when it happens and I haven't found any other possible consistencies. Sometimes it happens a few times throughout the day, sometimes it'll be fine for weeks. I haven't checked online to see if others have had the same issue and come up with a solution; there may be answers out there.My biggest gripes are that the touch buttons at the bottom don't light up and that Asus announced that this device was set to update to Marshmallow months ago and it hasn't happened. One of the reasons that I bought this phone was because I was expecting to get the update, so I'm bummed about it, but I'll live. (UPDATE: 2 days after writing this review, I got the update lol)Other than that, call quality, audio, mic, camera, etc are serviceable. It's not the type of phone that's going to impress your friends who have the latest flagship device, but it's solid and performs well. The storage and RAM have been great. I wish that the phone charged faster, but at least the battery life is good, so I don't have to plug it up at often as my previous phones. I'm not sure if it's the device itself or the power save settings that I put in place or both, but this phone has better standby ability than any smartphone I've ever had. The battery doesn't drain nearly as quickly as I was expecting.When I bought this phone, it was because of the specs and the price point. Compared to the other phones with similar features and pricing, this was the best choice for me. Though I like this phone, I plan to spend more on my next phone, budget willing.(7/25/16 Update: Forgot to mention another issue that I've been having since May. Every now and then, the phone will be plugged up to charge, but won't charge. It's happened about 5 times in the last 2 months. The cord will be plugged in, the LED will indicate that the phone is charging, and the device will vibrate to show that charging has been initiated, but the battery icon on the status bar won't include the charging symbol and indicate that the phone is charging. I can confirm that when this happens, the device is not charging because the battery will continue to drain despite being plugged up. It's happened with a myriad of different cords and situations and the only constant has been the device. Eventually it will start charging as it should and the charging graphic will show up in the battery icon. I never know when it's going to happen and it occurs at very inconvenient times; for instance, when my battery is almost dead and I'm trying to navigate using my GPS. Definitely not a time when I'd want my phone to die on me. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be keeping this phone.)Thanks for reading!

But the manual is vague at best.If your going to put in only name and # for the phone, I recommend you put it to the sim card. Twice now, we lost data that was saved to the watch, not sure why. It is supposed to have voice command capability, but could not get it to recognize any command.if you turn on voice for phone numbers to be audible, it only speaks in Chinese, no matter what language is selected.The plus side, calls a crisp and clear on the receiving end, and the speaker option to the watch is hard to hear. The MP 3 player is good with the included ear buds(only way mp3's can be played). The stylus is neatly tucked in the band, and does not slip out.The watch will accept a 16GB micro SD card. it keeps time well and can choose time as a screen saver, and then just tap the screen for it to display.

90490,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,"There are several excellent previous reviews that go into depth regarding the various (many) technical capabilities of the phone in great detail. This review will not attempt to duplicate those but to give my own experience and outlook in respect to the phone. This is my ""journey"" to finally purchasing the phone through Amazon.First of all, it ultimately took me about four months to purchase this phone! I began visiting a number of the several AT&T company stores in the Jacksonville, FL area late last March to try and see one in action. My 5-year old 3G Torch was still working well but the ""plastic"" above the ""go back"" and ""call end"" tool belt keys had simply worn out from use. It also was pretty darn slow whenever I needed to research something on the web when out of wireless internet service range.Despite AT&T announcing February availability, some of the stores I visited in late March - and after - claimed ""to not have one in stock yet"" or had ""only a display model"" (that would not turn on) - with disinterested sales agents I might add. (Note: none of the stores I visited acted in any way like they wanted to sell me this phone) This was puzzling as I had always previously experienced excellent service from the AT&T company stores. (Independents are quite another story) I even called AT&T customer service to find a list of the area stores that had a Classic in stock. Customer service of course offered to send me one directly but I really wanted to see one in action first.Finally, the covering on the two tool belt keys became so worn I ordered this phone through Amazon. Received the phone in a couple of days. Set up my email in five minutes. Connected to the home wireless in five minutes more. Waited a couple days and took it to one of AT&T company stores (where I had previously attempted unsuccessfully to buy one) for activation as a ""bring your own devise"".The young agent I drew was obviously unfamiliar with the Classic and fumbled a bit but proceeded with the activation process. It took him a few minutes to authorize and insert the smaller SIM card and a while longer to transfer the contacts. He was unable to transfer the calendar however. After several lengthy attempts, I told him I would simply rekey them into the new phone. Although he was outwardly courteous, it was obvious he did not did not agree with my choice of phone.As an observation, during the activation process, other ""freed up"" customer service agents were observed at nearby tables playing games and watching videos on their personal phones while awaiting other customers to come in. It should be noted that these were all ""twenty something"" in age.A few weeks with this phone confirms that I made the right choice for me. This phone has truly excellent call quality - the best I've ever experienced in any cell phone. We have a number of IPhone and Android models in the family and absolutely none of them approach this phone for call clarity and quality.The calendar function is similar to the old Torch but has enhanced functionality. Email and wireless internet setup was ridiculously simple. The SYNC/Bluetooth setup for the car literally took 2 minutes! Texting, access to contacts, scheduling, settings changes and overall functionality are fast and easy. The track pad, physical keyboard and tool belt make this unmatched for me as a business phone. The Blackberry Assistant is new for me. Like Siri, useful - but also frustrating. It also plays games but if that is your number one priority then this is not likely the phone for you.Hassle free durability is key for me and the construction of this phone seems to have it. Stainless steel frame, Corning Gorilla Glass, textured back. Battery life is certainly ""all day"". I have even gotten two days from this phone on occasion. Family members who own IPhones have spent a fortune over the past couple years - repairs, replacement costs, moisture sensitivity and battery life issues are things they deal with that I didn't want.",5,6

Using the phone for a couple of weeks, the roughness now is gone and the scratch is merely a minor cosmetical issue.Accurate description & quick shipping[update]DRAWBACKS OF THE GALAXY S3 MINIMy biggest frustration is the camera & exposure.

90095,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,"The speaker on my BlackBerry classic -- which I received new and unlocked from Amazon.com back in mid-January 2015 -- has ceased to work. The alarm makes no sound. The speaker makes no sound. I can't watch YouTube unless I do so via phone jack. And I've had it less than two months. I was an early adapter to BlackBerry, but, when the quality started to drop I went with several iterations of the iPhone. Because I prefer a physical keyboard I eventually tried the Q10 which was better than BlackBerry's previous efforts but not quite there. When the Classic came out, I paid full price for an unlocked version from Amazon.com. The first one I received had problems syncing calendar invitations from people with iPhones. Then a key fell off, and, because I'd had the device for less than a month, Amazon sent me a new one. Now the speakerphone has died on the replacement device. I work for a large law firm where nearly everyone has abandoned BlackBerry so I am exactly the type of person BlackBerry should want as a return customer. And yet, unlike with Apple, it is nearly impossible to get help or support from these people. It is as if they want to fail.",1,15

Remember this was a NEW phone.I tried 3 different 3.5 good quality headsets to make sure it was NOT just my jack(s).I called Samsung USA and they rep said they wouldn't FIX a Samsung that was made somewhere other country.So if the seller had another brand of phone I wanted I'd buy form them again.BUT I would NOT buy a Samsung phone, ever, no matter where it was made.If a company, and I use that term loosely, can not warranty a product made with ""THEIR NAME"" on it, they do NOT have any business pretending to be the same ""company"" as the subsidiarity that made the device.

It is the fastest device I've ever used with the stunning 3 GB of RAM (compared to newest iPhone's 1 GB). I love photography and with the 16 MP (newest iPhone has 8 MP), this is by far better than even $200 dollar cameras you find in stores. The 32 GB of memory provide all the room I could possibly want. I have had this phone for over 8 months now and still have over 14 GB left after all apps and music have been downloaded. The speakers provide great sound (better than any iPhone) and the bulge of the camera can easily be covered by a case, and I don't think it's worth buying the S7 just for the flat camera. I haven't had a single problem with anything about this phone. Last thing, the charger for this thing is absolutely beast. It is a fast charger built specifically for this phone and charges from 1% to 100% in just 1 hour. I bought the wireless charger but never use it because of this amazing charger, I wouldn't waste time and money on the wireless because it takes so much longer to charge.

197494,HTC Radar C110E Unlocked GSM Phone - White/Silver,HTC,"The Radar, from HTC, is my first personal foray into the smart phone world. After seeing the usefulness of my wife's iPhone, I decided it was time to upgrade. Since we have the Walmart family plan (which is, incidentaly, carried over T-Mobile's network) I had to do some research. Price was a consideration, as well, since I would have to pay for the phone outright. Going in I expected it to be a choice between the iPhone and an Android phone. After reading about, and talking to people who have them, I ruled out an Android phone because of bugginess, instability, what have you. While looking, I started to explore the possibility of a Windows phone as a possible alternative to the iPhone. Shockingly, the new Windows Phone OS is very good and more ""modern"" than the other two. By modern, I mean that the behemoth that is Windows is taking some risks to move forward in design and functionality. iOS is iOS is iOS. Basil Hayden on the rocks. Smooth, comfortable, reliable. Android is the feral child. Linux, minus the security and stability that makes Linux so great. Thanks, Google. Finally there's Windows. The giant Evil Empire. This time, though, Windows seems to have really built a good product. It's fast, it's stable, it's intuitive. It takes a little getting used to, like a move from Windows on a PC to a Mac or Linux interface, but once you do, it's second nature. The biggest knock so far is the lack of apps. If you really need to find every last time and soul sucking game out there, Windows Phone doesn't have all of them. If you're looking for a phone that can actually help you be more productive then I see the Windows Phone as a viable option. With a number of games and apps, mind you, just not the hundreds of thousands in the Android and iPhone universe (yet). As for the phone itself, my price range was limited, as I stated. I needed an unlocked, preferably T-Mobile phone. This came down to a Nokia (700 series, I believe), and the Radar. After physically handling both I felt the HTC was the more durable feeling. After a few weeks I'm very happy with my purchase. My only small niggle is the limited storage at 8 GB. At my price point, though, I can live with it.",4,3

I patiently went through three days of customer service calls to the ""support"" department of Virgin Mobile only to be told each time that the problem would be ""escalated"" the the appropriate technical department and would be fixed in 24 hours. For three successive days, I did this dance without resolution. Each time I called they would tell me that there was no record of my previous call or notation that the service request had been ""escalated."" I asked each time for a reference # or case number to follow up, but they said that they simply did not do this. On the 4th call, I was finally told that the problem would take between 24 hours and 6 DAYS to address.The final kick in the teeth was when I finally became fed up enough to switch to a different carrier, Virgin Mobile would not cancel my account... again promising to ""escalate"" the request for cancellation. And because they have not complied with the porting regulations, texts that should go to the new service, have kept going to the Virgin phone. Calling their service ""incompetent"" is generous.

This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product).If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point.Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!).If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem.NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in pink).

They told me to contact Samsung yet another time, who confirmed what they said earlier.The thing to keep in mind is if you buy an unlocked phone from Mobile Connections you have NO WARRANTY.

200977,Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,"The phone looks pretty. I used the phone without recharging for 3 days, while I frequently browsed internet and watched two movies (~3 hours).The screen resolution is good enough for human eyes. It is hard to visualize difference in pixel density between the ~245 ppi screen of this phone and those high-end ~450 ppi full HD screens, such as those of Galaxy S4 and LG G2.The phone does not heat up at all unless I play some games which demand a lot of processing. To be honest, I do not recommend you playing games on any smartphone, as they are good at draining power and therefore will eventually kill the batteries.The phone runs apps as fast as (maybe even faster than) all the high-end phones despite its suboptimal CPU, probably because it does not need to support full-HD display. The 2 G RAM is more than enough for this phone. Usually, there is more than 1 G RAM free, while Galaxy S4 and LG G2 are often on the edge of being short of RAM memory. That is probably why Galaxy S5 and LG G3 now have 3 G RAM installed.Overall, I think the hardwares are well combined to allow excellent performance, although individually only the ~4000 mAh battery represents the best of its kind on the market. I highly recommend you buying a phone with a high-capacity battery rather than a power-draining super-high resolution screen which cannot be well appreciated by human eyes.The only thing which bothers me a little is the power key on the side of the phone as I frequently hit it unintentionally. It would be better to redesign it to respond over double or triple clicks. Is it possible to write up an app to accomplish this?",5,3

The clarity of the display is really excellent and above average. The MP3 player is definitely well above average in sound quality. This phone does so many things so well that it almost gets a rating of 5.My main gripes are with some really important things. The keyboard's feel is poor with the keys too close together. The joystick works great when new but degrades if used for more than basic functions, like playing the provided games. The camera lens cover and buldge is not great but never really bothered me that much. Really the joystick is a feature I'll never have in another phone because it's just not durable and D-pads work just as well.I now use a T-Mobile Dash and it excels at many things the k790a stumbles on but does not offer the same level of sound quality nor close to as good a camera. It is more useful for work, surfing the web and dealing with email and really makes the k790a look like more of a toy (but a great one) in comparison. The k790a will be for sale soon.",4,3

The team looks really nice, stylish design, is very fast, the screen looks great, and very responsive to touch. The new keyboard is really comfortable, really predictive text learns the words you use and it made me very easy to use. Has back and front camera so you can take a picture of yourself without having to turn the phone, when you take a photo makes it very fast, immediately by touching any part of the screen, and you can edit the photo right there unused no additional application, rotate, cut, add effects, etc.., keeping you keeping the edited copy and the original. One thing that caught my attention is that you can connect remotely to your computer and manipulating the cell can go see the photos you're going on your z10 and appear on your wireless pc so has other remote access options I have not used yet but they look interesting. Comes with word, excel, power point and adobe reader installed, so there is no problem with documents.The phone though is great as all new high-end phone is slim and can be worn comfortably with one hand, the material is quite comfortable to hold and feels like behind-slip rubber. The moves to get from one place to another are simple and easy to learn. The hub is spectacular and shows you all notifications in one place and to click you can review and respond without any problem and from any application in which you're easily return to it with a single movement, so you have to hand all updates or interaction in social networks to a single step and from my point of view this new operating system based on gestures makes everything is very close, save steps and therefore everything is done faster.I recommend this phone because it is an excellent team, very fast, really nice, comfortable and easy to handle.

Comes with a protective clear rubber case, nice, minimalist, so you have everything you need to start using it out of the box.SIM 1 (main one) is normal size SIM.SIM 2 (second line) is MicroSIM.ADDITIONAL MEMORY: MicroSD up to 64Gb, I'm using a 16Gb MicroSD Lexar and works perfect.CAMERA: is fine, not superb, but much better than the average, very close to Samsung's resolution. Flash really fills at night.BATTERY LIFE: I have been using it for 10 days as far no problems, I use FBmessenger, Whatsapp, DropBox, email all of them all day long and I do a lot of talking... phone is got 25% battery at 10pm, this is amazing. Didn't expect to last so much, because of the big screen.SCREEN: big & nice screen, high resolution, besides the packaging screen plastic protector, there is a formal screen protector installed on the phone. It works fine, screen touch is very responsive, video runs smoothly and pictures look great. Nice contrast during day and is got AUTO set so it compensates brightness automatically.Seriously, this is an excellent phone and makes me feel bad for those who paid $700 for similar ones from famous brands... This phone is got everything.I'll keep this review up to date, about durability and quality mostly.",5,2

194032,HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Glacial Silver),HTC,"The most cost efficient way of getting a great smartphone, ie get last year's model for about 298 bucks! It's fast, it works, IT'S UNLOCKED!!!!! and, even though the seller didn't sell it that way, it appears to be brand spankin' new! Even the power plug and the usb cable were still in their factory wrappers. Not a single scratch. And although this model is verizon banded, I use the t-mobile 30 dollar a month plan (5 gigs lte 100 minutes unlimited msgs) which is unbeatable (available only through some Wallmarts). I took it over to t-mobile and was told a similar offer from ATT on this phone would've been a problem because they lock their phones down - even when they say it is unlocked and I'd have to contact ATT for unlocking.I've noticed that LTE on t-mobile is not consistent enough to use where I live so I use the HSPA+ UTMS option. If you select the LTE, it eventually goes down all the way to 3g and edge, however using the legacy lte is the way to go when using t-mobile as you will almost instantly kick down to the available frequencies if LTE isn't available. Most likely you'd be using bwtn 3g and HSPA+ (to get to this setting use settings > Mobile data > Preferred Network > and you'll have three choices. The most flexible is LTE/legacy 3GPP mode which gives you a choice of GSM/GPRS/EDGE only Mode, UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+ only mode, or LTE only mode. UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+ provides the flexibility and most continuous connectivity I need.Also, although I am not using verizon as my carrier, connecting this sucker to a windows computer allows you to get all the upgrades via a verizon app. I am quite happy with this purchase and I have also purchased a powerbear battery case (on amazon) for protection and lots more battery life - two days ago it was 19 bucks today I see it is around 90....go figure.Real life with the screen. OK, yesterday I inadvertently pushed it off a table an it landed face down onto a concrete floor. (about 3 and a half feet or so).

I have been a part of the android herd since I first bought a galaxy S5 and have experienced several operating systems and a range of device specs. Having said that, this device is really great.Pros+Runs stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow. This runs very fluidly on the device. The UI is snappy and colorful.+1080p Gorilla Glass 3: The screen looks great and is easy on the eyes, but can be bright when you need it. Also, it is fairly resistant to scratches from everyday use.+The camera takes excellent quality photos. The rear camera takes a 12.3 megapixel shot and has special modifications to make low light pictures maintain high resolution.+The selfie camera doesn't look bad, however I never use it.+The Battery life is pretty awesome. With a full charge, I can go all day with moderate to heavy usage (I get bored at work.) The Battery also quick charges so a few minutes of charging goes a long way.+The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. It is placed on the back of the phone for ease of use. Most people rest their hand naturally in this fashion on the phone so it is snappy to unlock.Cons-The phone itself is plastic and feels kind of cheap in the hands. The upside to this is that the material it is made out of gives you a good amount of grip while holding the phone.-The loudspeaker on the phone sounds cheap and tinny and doesn't carry a lot of bass. This is expected, however, from a budget phone and doesn't bother me personally. I have many bluetooth devices I connect to.-As always, there is no removable storage and this is a bit of an inconvenience. You have the option of purchasing a 16 or 32GB model and that is all you get. This will be plenty for most people day in day out. For movie enthusiasts this can prove a problem.-One of the only phones that uses USB type-C. This is kind of a problem because no local retailers sell this type of cord, and the cord that comes with the phone you cannot plug into a regular USB 2.0. I have not been able to sync anything to the phone yet, but I have downloaded music from google play.Overall:This is a great phone. I have had a lot of fun with it and my nerdy friends have been impressed by the stock android and simple efficiency of the device. They like to tote around their Note 5's while I rock my Nexus. For the price this is a great buy and one that I am very satisfied with.",4,1

A 1080p screen on a cell phone is more than enough. Actually, 720p is fine. The LG Optimus G (predecessor) was such a great phone as well. Both devices are quad core, 2 gigs of ram, but of course, the improvements in the LG G2 make it a worthwhile investment if you're looking to upgrade to this device.

161831,BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,"The last phone I bought was a BLU Life One X and I absolutely love it. Since I am a mobile developer, I constantly buy new phones and this one seemed to be a great value for the price.Unpacked, popped in the T-Mo SIM, and off it went, merrily connecting to the universe. While it isn't running stock Android like a Nexus device, it's close enough. There is no skin (thank you!) and only a few add-on apps. The only painful one is the camera - you lose the ability to do panoramas with this one, and the Google Camera app won't start.The device is absolutely pretty. Everybody wants to hold it and nobody believes how cheap it was. It's incredibly thin and light, to the point where I don't use the wallet case I bought for it because it feels like the phone suddenly doubled in weight.The hardware is fast and apps start with little delay. The camera is decent - nothing that will blow your mind, but the shots it takes (both front and back) are good enough for casual use. Charging is quick and the charge lasts astonishingly long for such a small phone (which, consequently, has a small battery).I would have given it five full stars, and I am absolutely going to buy more BLU phones. There are two issues, though, that have bewildered several reviewers and that make this phone a pain to use.1. Some apps won't run on this phone. I mentioned the stock Camera app - it would not start on this or the other BLU I have. I don't know what apps work and why some don't. Most apps, for sure, can be installed and run just fine. I am also having problems running apps in debug mode, but that's just for developers.2. The GPS is incredibly flaky. It will lock onto the satellites and two minutes later declare it lost the connection - despite the fact you are driving in a wide open field on a sunny day with clear skies. It also takes forever for the GPS to lock in the first place. That's particularly tragic because Google Maps and Driving Directions is completely useless without GPS. The moment the signal drops, until the signal is back again, you will not get any directions.Frankly, item 2. is a really huge deal for me. The other BLU I have doesn't exhibit the problem, so it's not a general issue with these phones. Also, the GPS location is accurate when it actually is established, so it's not a matter of a defective GPS chips, necessarily. Too bad, otherwise this is a great phone.",3,3

It was a jail broken 2009 ATT iPhone 3GS, so old that it was outside of the factory warranty period (even if it had not been jail broken).I found that the phone was not a factory unlocked Apple iPhone when I updated the software on the iPhone. The iPhone locked up. It spent most of a day trying to find out the cause of the phone suddenly not functioning. The ten hours of work on the problem culminated in a two hour visit to an Apple Store where I learned that Wireovia had sold me a jail broken 2009 ATT iPhone 3GS, not a new unlocked one as advertised.Initially, when I contacted and explained the item I had received was not the one advertised, Wireovia response was to suggest that Apple was making up stuff. I explained to them why this assertion was incorrect. Apparently, Wireovia thinks a 2009 iPhone with a major unauthorized software modification and no warranty is the same as a new iPhone. I, on the other hand, do not. I then explained that there was a considerable difference between the item described and what they sold me.Wireovia finally reluctantly agreed to refund my money.Wireovia, however, has been less than quick in refunding my money. And the refund has been less than full. The refund Wireovia finally did give was not a full refund on the purchase price--they shorted me $50 when they sent me an obviously wrongly identifed item--let alone the shipping to and from for which they are also liable.Obviously, I am not happy with the seller. Nor was I happy with the phone as it was not an unlocked iPhone but a jail broken one.If you don't want a jail broken 2009 iPhone, you may want to avoid Wireovia. No matter who the seller is, you probably will need to have the seller be very specific in telling you what you will be receiving.BTW, Amazon's own policy states that selling jail broken iPhones is prohibited, at least as of today. If these iPhones are prohibited items, why does Amazon continue to allow them to be sold? Amazon should either stop the sales on its site or remove jail broken iPhones from the prohibited list.",1,32

When I return to the States I am wording a strong letter to Amazon. I do not think they should allow these companies to have paid or give their phoen free in exchange for reviews. These people gave reviews on this phone that cannot possibly be true. I have bought many phone from Amazon sellers THERE IS NO WAY THIS PHONE IS A 4 OR 5 STAR. IT IS CRAP. DO NOT BUY IT!

I used a free trial version of an app to do it just once once and since then, I'm only using Google calender and contacts (and very pleased). Not everything was synced properly, so it all had to be checked and corrected manually.- The shape of the charger plug is wrong for my country's electric sockets. I got the one that fits the socket in UK and had to go out and buy an adapter (about 2-5$). Would be great if the buyer could choose the type of socket.- Price is little bit higher then straight from Google Play, but they do not service my country yet.All in all a very good buy!",5,8

I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently.

230481,LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 16GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,"The first Android phone I loved was my Nexus 4. Before that I had a Galaxy Note which I hated (the UI and performance), and after the Nexus 4 I foolishly tried a Moto X through Republic Wireless. Yikes. I hated that phone/service combination. It was atrocious. Anyway, after two years of getting by, we finally budgeted enough money to enable me to purchase a Nexus 5x. I'm happy to report that it is a fantastic phone. I was really torn between this one or the 6P, but I'm glad I went with the 5x. I saved myself $150.00, and I got all the phone I wanted. The 5x has a wonderful screen which is crisp and bright, very long battery life and it's light and study. And it takes excellent clear pictures and the fingerprint scanner is a welcome addition. Make sure to optimise the battery life on your new Nexus 5x and turn down the brightness a bit and you'll get 15-20 or more hours of battery life. It is a wonderful thing to be able to unplug it in the morning, go all day without worrying about running out of battery, and plug it in late at night when I go to bed. Performance wise I've had no issues. Everything is fast and fluid. Granted I don't really do any gaming on it or anything, but for what I use it for I'm very happy with how it performs. So if you're like me with an aging phone (like the first gen Moto X) and you're debating between this one and the 6P, I highly recommended this one. One other note: I have very large hands and I find I can barely operate this phone one handed. I imagine I wouldn't be able to operate the larger 6P one handed nearly as well. I note that some other reviewers have received 5x's with issues, but mine has been perfect. It's just a beautiful fast phone with a great OS. Thanks Google and LG!The case I bought (which I also highly recommend) is the Verus thin case. It fits like a glove, doesn't make the phone bulky, and looks great.",5,3

I have had a few Nokia phones in the past and thought that I wanted another one so I tried this. I did not know the Windows system for phones was so poor. I can't see how long I have talked in a previous conversation. I can't find numbers in my phone by entering the first few numbers. I can't adjust the earpiece volume unless I am in the call. I have tried to link it to three different email accounts. I am able to use one. Ironically, it is not the Outlook (Microsoft ie Windows) account I have from work. The one thing that it does have that no other phone I have ever owned is stored maps of the entire US. Some of the maps are out-of-date, but it is still nice sometimes. I just tried to download a new app from the Microsoft store that won't open. I can not sort my pictures into albums that I create. The emoticons in the text messages take a lot more characters than in an Android phone. I do not recommend this phone if you will do anything other than talk on it.

11588,Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,"The bottom line is that I disliked this phone so much that I returned it! I know you're not supposed to say that about Apple products, but read on to see why I think people are largely ""drinking the Koolaid"" on the iPhone.The Bad: When I first wanted a smartphone I got a very cheap Droid, which was hard to sync between the Mac home computer I use and my Google email accounts. Eventually I got it working, but I anticipated that the almighty iPhone would be seamless right out of the box. It wasn't -- with the iPhone I had all the same troubles going back to the Google accounts that I had had with the Droid going to the Apple products the first time around. Not fun.I also didn't like that there is NO app available to back SMS text messages up to your Gmail or other email account the way there is for Android phones (SMS Backup+). In the event of a phone change, and god forbid you do not want another iProduct, you will lose all of those conversations.I couldn't organize the screens the way I wanted them.I missed having my contacts' pictures show up next to text messages and in my phone address book. (It's the little things, but still!)The ""back"" menus will probably frustrate former Droid users, as sometimes you have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the phone to go back to the Home screen, but sometimes you want the real ""back"" button on the screen which is usually (but not always) located at the top. This is counterintuitive and annoying.The Good: The camera worked well, the screen was beautiful and the sound was good. Size is great compared to the other expensive Android models which are a bit like holding an entire computer up to your head. Also, there are no rights issues with older iTunes purchases which I have yet to resolve on my new Android.The Verdict: Overall I was disappointed in the operating system I think largely because the iPhone is supposed to be the gold standard among smartphones and I had heard wonderful, glowing things from so many people who LOOOOVE their iPhones. However, naysayers come out of the woodwork once they realize that they will have a sympathetic ear in someone who isn't subscribing blindly to the iUniverse, and there are a fair number of people who prefer the Droids. To me the final factor may be how computer-savvy you are going in, and how much time you want to put into learning about your phone and all the different service providers and programs that will, in theory at least, work together to get it to do what you want it to do. If you're willing to take the time, you might eventually prefer an Android. If not, the iPhone is definitely not as simple as I thought it would be but I would still recommend it for anyone who doesn't have the technological know-how or desire to play detective in order to get things set up.I will add that when combined with trying to find the right cellular service provider (Verizon has NONEXISTANT customer service and everything requires several phone calls as well as hours on hold to get anything done, AT&T has less signal strength in my area and I couldn't get usable data to with T-Mobile through Straight Talk), buying a new phone and a smartphone in particular has been one of THE most frustrating experiences of my life. Once I get my current phone working (a Samsung Galaxy S3), I plan to keep it forever and to never, ever, ever make any changes to my ""system"" again! What an exercise in futility this has been!",1,3

The average smart phone user may not consider this phone a wise choice because it is not a popular brand. Compared to other well-known smart phones, this phone holds its own. This phone is ideal for those who use their smart phones for extensive work purposes as well as those who do not do as much on their phones.My main reason for ordering this phone was because of its advertised long battery life, and it has met this expectation as it can run for 3-7 days on a single charge, depending on usage. It also has a 30 day stand by time when not used, all on a single charge. Even this phone takes many hours to fully charge, there is an option for a 10minute quick charge that gives the user 1 hour of talk time. Most of the brand name smart phones such as the Samsung Galaxy I have used do not come close to this.Another feature of the BLU Energy X2 smart phone is 8MP main camera and 5MP front selfie camera, both of which take excellent pictures. The phone also comes with 1.3 GHz processor and 8GB internal memory, 1 GB RAM Micro SD which is expandable to 64GB. These features give the user ample storage space and also makes it possible to download many apps.This phone is ridiculously affordable compared to other smart phones, coming in at under $150.

141754,"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,"Terrific phone at a great price. The screen is beautiful, and big, and all my friends who've looked at the phone have been impressed with it. This is my first cell phone of any kind, and I have had a big learning curve. (Also bought Android for Dummies, a Kenu plus sized car holder for it, car charger and cable, SD storage card, and a belt loop case holder.)Reading through all the previous reviews of this phone has been really helpful for figuring out many things in advance. For instance, if you want to use a 64GB SD storage card, or larger, you need to reformat it to FAT32. An online You Tube tutorial guided me through that handily, including downloading a program that did the hard work for me. Various apps also recommended in previous reviews were helpful. (For the ""reboot problem"" some reviewers complained of, a previous review says to check the silicon backing case that comes with phone. I have not had any such problems, so maybe they fixed the case?)So far I am impressed. Great big high resolution screen really mattered to me. Everything so far seems to work beautifully.. Speed and responsiveness seem excellent. Very nice that BLU includes the protective screen already on phone and a silicone back case protector and earbuds. The only reason I've lowered one star: sound management. There's what seems to be a not infrequent ANDROID problem (i.e., not only Blu phones): when I listen to the FM radio through the ear buds, it's just too loud, even on the lowest volume setting. Nice that it HAS an FM radio, not all phones do--I'm trying to solve the volume problem with apps, but that's cumbersome. Other sound tasks (Pandora, Amazon music) are not too loud with the earbuds, only the radio. I haven't yet used the actual phone call function with earbuds. But in any case the sound levels are something I'd like more control over than I've been finding I have. Maybe some of that's ignorance--I'd like to make the notifications quieter while keeping ring tone loud (except NOT with earbuds in--I have no idea if I'd be deafened if I got a call while listening on earbuds). I'd like to see settable sound profiles with and without the earbuds and more gradations between one sound level and the next on the phone's own volume control..Still learning the camera also. This phone may not be the best to use for camera purposes, because the size makes it hard to hold onto in less than ideal circumstances. But I wanted the big screen for other reasons, so that's a trade off I chose, even though I didn't realize at the time I was choosing it. The quality of the few photos I've taken thus far is really good--outside, in daylight. Low light without flash, not so great. I plan to get a camera app recommended by another reviewer to see if I like it better than the one that comes with the phone.Summing up: I'm very happy to get a big and very high quality smartphone unlocked at this price. I'm starting out with the least expensive T-Moblie $30/month plan and like knowing that I can change to another plan or different GSM cell phone service provider any time I want. I wanted to be able to buy a local SIM in Europe and the second SIM card was a big plus for me with this phone. The phone does sound as if it's especially well tuned for use on T-Mobile--I picked my carrier because of reading that here. But meanwhile, unlocked seems to me the only fair thing--price a phone reasonably and then let the user go where he/she wants with it. Thanks, BLU.My one silly regret so far: I got black. I think the white would have been more elegant.",4,4

261436,"Nokia 7705 Twist Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless) Works With Page Plus And Red Pocket cdma Verizon",Nokia,"Sound quality good. Resolution good. User interface good. This phone satisfied my requirements: Ease of use. Intuitive operation. Design targeted to text, phone call and messaging.Its diminutive size naturally complements a small footprint that doubles with the flick of the user's finger. Remarkably, I have no trouble hearing the different tone notifications (set up by the user) and am able to respond as quickly as my recently purchased Android smart phone. The ability to tag photos with each caller, immediately route to voice mail or respond, or answer seem to flow so easily that I feel I have lost nothing in comparison to my wife's iPhone or my Android. Also remarkably, the speaker on this Twist performs better than my new smart phone.Ironically, when considering its age, the younger crowd finds the square phone appealing. Also, the swivel ring lights up with user specified colors depending on who is calling.One Con for Some: Though I don't play apps on my phones, the user of the Twist will find apps for the Twist expensive compared to today's apps for both iPhone and Android.Within one week of use, this is my favorite phone. Considering it was implemented in 2009, I may buy another one as backup when this one falls apart.One last point: While my other phones are on contract, I chose to pay-as-I-go each month with Horizon. I had noticed another reviewer stating such a plan was not available. Well, it is. For $40, I get unlimited text and calls, and 1G of download.*** UPDATE ***Another positive to this phone is the battery life. Though I don't employ the phone's many features, and considering the features that I do employ are not constantly used, I still find the battery life remarkable. I can leave the phone on for several days without the need to charge it. Currently, I have had the phone on three days (without charging involved) and the battery symbol is down only one bar (four possible).From an ergonomic view, the diminutive phone size (when closed), and when coupled with a phone pouch (appropriate phone case to hold the phone) that you wear is very comfortable. I suppose that point seems obvious since the phone is a smaller footprint. Still, I wanted you to know you will not feel the bumping and bulging experienced with the normal smart phone case. Since I wear a suit to work, I like the small footprint that does not force my suit jacket to accommodate what is usually a bigger phone case in today's world.Another CON: That phone's backplate does shift when using the keyboard. By *shift* I mean it is flimsy. But, it has not fallen off and serves its purpose.",5,2

394246,"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,"Sony makes a great phone, and I thoroughly enjoy my Xperia Z3 Compact. Battery life is forever, size is perfect, and calls sound great. (I'm on AT&T near a major USA metropolitan area).There are a few minor issues worth noting:1. The USB charge port is behind a loosely connected cover. Over time, the cover will probably break off, as the connector is very a thin piece of plastic. I purchased a magnetic charger to avoid this potential issue.2. NO OTB GROUP TEXTING. This is super frickin' annoying. I've had to download a texting app.3. Screen brightness is OK. Coming from a Motorola RAZR M, I miss rich bright colors that are unphased outdoors. There's nothing wrong with the screen. It looks great, but it really should be brighter for outdoor use.4. Sound is kinda low volume. Line out, hand-set out, and speakerphone are kind of week. They get the job done, but would be better if they maxed out at another 25%. Really, this is only an issue in noisy environments.UPDATE:- I LOVE THE DEDICATED CAMERA BUTTON. I can't believe I forgot to mention this in the original review.- Battery life is still awesome. If I leave in the morning (0700) with 100% charge, I know I can make it home (2200) with 30% left. Texting, surfing, and 1 or 2 calls is typical for me.- The default keyboard is a mixed bag: there is a very good 'swype' like feature that supports dragging your finger from key-to-key to type, however, there is no access to voice typing from. Obviously, being the Android platform, other keyboards can be downloaded",5,1

162171,BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,"So… I haven’t used the phone much yet. I bought it as a secondary phone to my Blackberry Z30 solely to run apps. Newer Blackberries are productivity beasts but with most android apps now needing Google Play Services, the app situation is dire.The BLU seemed like a sexy secondary phone that wouldn’t take up too much room in my pocket. I wasn’t expecting much given the price and unknown company. It’s extremely thin and that takes some getting used to. I’m actually impressed with how thin it is, this is really an engineering marvel. Old Nokias had keypads that were thicker than this phone. I still long for the superior engineering of my N9, but this takes what’s possible to a new level. Design wise you can clearly see where BLU got their inspiration from Apple and Sony.Something so thin was bound to come with compromises. The camera is decent at best. The LED on the back is very dim. The speakers are loud but the sound is mediocre. The battery is passable but not great.Luckily the reception seems to be decent. The thin metal frame obviously serves as an antenna so how you hold it can be a game changer. The screen is crisp, bright, and better than expected. The hardware seems fast enough, but I haven’t pushed it too hard yet.The downsides are tolerable to me. Remember this thing sells for a quarter of what a new iPhone will set you back unlocked and with no contract. Apple probably makes $500 on an $800 phone. These guys probably make less than $5 a unit after all is said and done, depending on the model.I did have a problem with the phone getting stuck in an infinite reboot loop when I took it out of the packaging and went to charge it. I think something happened between the factory and my house where the phone turned on and completely drained the battery. The packaging was actually really nice so I'm thinking the factory screwed up. The phone would try and boot but then crash and shut off as it gasped for power. This wouldn’t have been an issue but the phone would try and reboot itself again a few seconds later.I called into technical support and someone answered right away. They did not solve the problem and the only offered solution was to return it to amazon for a new one. I was pretty pissed but the two people I spoke with on the phone remained professional and seemed competent. I’m not sure where expectations should be for this. I’m somehow simultaneously disappointed and impressed. I must be in a better mood as the issue somehow resolved itself after leaving it on my charger for a couple of hours.As far as my Blackberry 10 vs Andriod thoughts, I think Andriod sucks as an operating system. I know google is tracking every single click I make and it’s uncomfortable. I have to make more clicks in Android vs BB10 to accomplish the same tasks. The multitasking sucks on Andriod. BB10 is realtime. Minimize a Youtube video in Android and you’ll see what I mean.That said, it’s nice to have a fully functional Play Store and not worry about apps stealing information. The two phone solution is a winner so far for me, and the Vivo Air LTE is fitting the bill quite nicely.",5,1

392880,Sony Xperia Z1 C6903 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE WaterProof Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera and Shatter-Proof Glass - Black,,"So recent phones I've had include:*Note 2+ Amazing Battery, S-Pen- Thick, Had a hardware issue with headphone jack*HTC ONE+ Loudest, snappy, good battery, most premium, and best screen- Easy to scratch, not too many cover choices*Galaxy S4+ Great Dev support, slimmest, and lightest- LAGGY with factory Touchwiz setupNow the Sony Z1! This phone is a beast! Out of the past phones this one is all of the positives combined! Has the battery of the Note Series, the premiem materials of the HTC ONE, and the Dev support of the S4. When I first opened this phone I loved how nice it felt in my hand. Now the phone wasn't perfect though! I believe the model I received was for a German T-mobile carrier. It had a bit of bloat, but was neutralized after I flashed factory 4.2.2 firmware. Since then it's been dead reliable and is often a conversation starter! If you're not getting data or LTE, make sure your APN settings are correct under the settings. Okay on with the review, It's battery lasts me all day (5-6hr screen on time @ 15hr+ overall life). If you're not getting near those figures make sure you cycle the battery a few times (Cycle = full charge to 0 percent battery). Then there's the Sony Camera. It performs great and shoots excellent quality photos. It's waterproof and dust proof. The only con of this phone is the tiny sound it produces, but his is the trade off for being water proof.The only other Android snapdragon competitors are G2, Nexus 5, and the Galaxy Note 3. Overall, the device is great and durable. I'd highly recommend it to people who are interested in a mature and elegant phone.**Update** I found out I have a dead pixel where the captive buttons are on the bottom part of the screen. I am a little upset that I only had this phone for a few weeks and had this problem. I enjoyed my short ownership with it, but I am upset a $600 device would suffer from this. If it were't for this I'd give the phone 5 stars.- Derek",3,4

I've only had this phone for about two months as of me writing this review, but this is the single most amazing phone I've ever had! I'm telling you now, if you have the money to invest into this phone, even if it's financed with something like Amazon Credit, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.My favorite feature though, is the camera.

293129,"POSH MOBILE EQUAL PRO 4G LTE ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 7.0"" HD World's BIGGEST Android Phone 16GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: L700 Black)",Posh Mobile,"So I was enticed by the large 7"" screen (it really is large) and the relatively low cost of this phone. For what it's worth, it does everything it's supposed to do, and it's worked just fine throughout the ~2 months that I've owned it, even after getting rained on fairly hard once. I'm a 6' male, and the size if this thing hasn't been a problem at all - it fits easily in the front pockets of all my pants, so don't let the size discourage you if that's what you're looking for. It's quite thin in profile, so it fits in pockets easily. I do have two major complaints with this phone that (for me) are deal-killers, though:1. The processor is agonizingly slow, from the very beginning (it's not like the phone is getting slower over time, it actually starts out like this). Apps can take anywhere between 5-10 seconds to open - and seriously, 5-10 seconds when you're trying to call someone on Skype or send a WhatsApp text is a long freakin' time.2. The GPS antenna is awful - even after I get GoogleMaps to finally load, and I've selected my destination, the message ""GPS signal lost"" stays on the screen for at least 50% of the time I'm driving. This is extremely frustrating in unfamiliar cities, where I've missed turns constantly due to lost GPS signal.Overall, it's not a terrible phone, and it's great for playing ""Clash of Clans"" and watching TV (because that huge screen is pretty cool), but the slow speed of the processor and the terrible GPS antenna mean that I'm back on the market now for another cellphone. The only thing I'm going to miss about this one are those ""Holy cow, that's the biggest phone I've ever seen!!"" comments every time I pull it out of my pocket. Always makes me smile. ""Why, thank you :)"".",3,2

Restarted and thought all was good. As I started to work on the phone it got really hot and I received a message that the UI was not longer workingI restarted several times but no luck. I have returned the phone, Amazon is great on stuff like this. I have chosen to go with the Moto X Pure Edition as it has the Snapdragon 808 vs the 810 that seems to have issues. I truly loved the size and feel of the Sony and was hoping the issues were do to bad users, unfortunately the units are probably just bad.

It went thru the setup process and almost immediately I noticed the home button was not turning the screen on. So I would hold home and volume down to get to reset screen. So I was thinking maybe the app restore function was causing the issue so I waited and randomly I could get the screen come on but only about 10% of the tries were successful. Then I received notification that the 6.0.1 update was available so I allowed it to process. Since then I have been unsuccessful getting the phone to do anything with the phone with the rare exception I hit the android reset screen but it doesn't help.

335633,"Samsung Galaxy S II 4G Prepaid Android Phone, Titanium (Virgin Mobile)",Samsung,"So a couple of weeks ago, I finally got fed-up with my old phone (the HTC EVO V 4G). It was laggy, the battery life was dreadful, and the camera on it--even though it was a 3D camera and claimed to be ""high quality""--sucked. Heck, ONE scratch on the lens part of the camera made it so the flash function added a greenish hue to every picture I took; I could basically not use my flash. Just imagine my frustration, especially considering this happened just a couple of months after owning it.What sucks is...when I bought this phone, the white, standard version of it was sold out, so I was forced to purchase the titanium version of it. Aside from the color, they're the exact same phone. Not too big of an issue, I guess.After having the Galaxy S2 for a bit, I can honestly say that this is the best phone I've ever owned(inb4 ""iPhones are the bestest!!1!"") No, they are not. I own the latest generations of iPad and iPod Touch and I can honestly say that I hate the iOS platform with the burning, fiery passion of a thousand suns. But that's a conversation for another time.I've owned several phones while being a member of Virgin Mobile - The Samsung Intercept, Motorola Triumph, Kyocera Rise, HTC EVO V, and now the Samsung Galaxy S2.Since I've had it, not once have I had an issue with the battery draining rapidly, the screen ALWAYS moves as quickly as I swipe it with no input lag. This thing is basically--as numerous reviews I've seen say--a mini supercomputer. Plus since Jelly Bean is now out for the Virgin Mobile of the Galaxy S2, the phone is even better than it was before. What more could I ask for, aside from it turning into a Transformer and assisting me in taking over Earth?I would definitely HIGHLY recommend this phone to those who are looking to purchase, especially if you're as tired as I was of scouring all over the place for the perfect Virgin Mobile phone.",5,37

Got it for the wife after the Microsoft Lumia 650 just wasn't cutting it. She needed a phone that would work with Messenger's audio and video (for calling overseas). Camera is nice. She had a 64GB card she took from her old phone and used with this one.I copied her contacts to a CSV file and using a computer was able to import to this Android phone. Seems to run smoothly.She mainly uses it for internet surfing, Facebook, messenger and YouTube. I'll probably introduce her to more Google apps in the future but those are the main uses she has now.It has a removable battery and I'm a bit old school and actually like that. Even so it's not really that bulky. It came with a charger and the charger is all one piece meaning it's not a AC adapter with a USB cord - just the charger. So you'll need your own headset and your own USB cord if you plan to connect to a computer (or use Bluetooth). I also don't think this phone support Wi-Fi 5 GHz as it picked up our 2.4GHz Wi-Fi but did not show the 5GHz.I did setup a Google account for her - it was not necessary but some things will not work without an account. No big deal as you can set one up and just ignore it if you don't plan to actually use pay apps. I'd write more but didn't spend a lot of time with the phone as it's in her hands now - which actually is a good thing, it means she's able to use the Android smartphone after being on a Nokia Windows phone for the last few years!",4,1

I am happy to report that I actually received the International version (RM-994) and not the Chinese version. This phone actually connected to T-Mobile and my Internet account without issue. I have been using the phone for several hours now without the unusual heating up that happened with the original purchase. I'll update this if anything crazy happens, but so far I am a happy camper. Warning for other interested buyers, make sure you get the correct version!Original:Within the first two days I've had this phone, I've encountered a few problems. First, the phone I received is not the ""International version"" and is instead the Chinese version (RM-994 vs RM-996). This seems to remove LTE and 4G capabilities. For unknown reasons, the phone became HOT when I was trying to figure out how to set up my network. It would also shut off randomly. A factory reset fixed that issue, but seeing as how it's a Chinese phone, it rebooted back in Chinese. I had to figure out how to get it back to English while also trying to get it past the factory reset instructions. After that, I still could not get it to access the network even after I went through troubleshooting with a tech for hours. During the last attempt, the phone stopped charging. I tried to wiggle the cord, remove it and reinsert it, and plugged other phones and tablets into the charger (which all charged). After that, I decided to be done. I know this phone has great capabilities, but the one I received was a lemon. I am returning it.",5,1

324195,"Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9005 Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 32GB, Black",Samsung,"Right out of the Box, the first I did was to connect to my home wifi for sync and download some of my bought app, to my frustration it didnt connect to my wifi even though all our gadgets works, all ipad, ipod, my Samsung Note tablet and Samsung S2 all connect flawleslly without problem, then I tried it on starbucks and 3 Hospital (because most of them uses 2.4ghz), it still didnt work. I manage to connect to my home wifi using 5ghz, The S-Pen is a bit bent.I also found out it lag a bit and after two months of use, I see heavier lag, battery is getting hot (even on Airplane mode), so the first thing I did is root to check stuff, and even tried other custom ROM to see if it fix the problem of my wifi and the Lag. So what I did next is to fix the lag first and check the RAM, I was surprise that the RAM has 1.39GB only, googled ""N9005 1.39GB RAM"" and found out there are fakes of Note 3 out thereI email'd the seller, and told that the RAM is 1.39GB instead of the regular 3GB (or 2.3-2.7GB), I also went and check at Best Buy, their RAM is somewhere 2.3GB, to cut the story short, the seller agreed to replace my Note 3. This one has about 1000 difference on the last IMEI, and was shock when I started to use the S-Pen, it has no button! Exposed. When I remove the plastic thing on the back plate, the letter S and M from the SAMSUNG word was peeledFirst thing every one should know, your not sure if your Note 3 is genuine any more, it can be imitated, my first Note 3 looks so genuine, the crisp of the screen, the name of the chips when you use those app infos about your phone, when I used a custom rom, even when re-flashing to stock rom, plus the knox warning all worked, the MHL cable that connects to your HDMI TV also worked, the only thing I knew it was fake is because of the RAM.Now I have my Note 3 replaced by the seller, RAM is now 2.38GB, Wifi is working now but I doubt now if it still original. When I first start the newly replaced Note 3, it didnt start from the welcome screen, instead it started on the home menu. Why would there be a missing button on the S-Pen, why would the IR Blaster not work even using the Stock WatchOn App? I also bought the Smart Remote and Universal Remote for Samsung just to test the IR blaster,and they all did not work on all our TVs (Samsung 60"" & Olevia 55) but they all work on My Note 10.1 Tablet that was bought from Costco3 stars because I still like my N9005 plus the seller agreed to replace the note 3. We will never know if the seller is the culprit or he got these from a culprit that he didnt knew. One thing is for sure, Im not going to buy another Samsung here even if the seller has the highest ratingUpdate:IR Blaster is working on my Olevia TV but you have to be 1 to 2 inch from the TV's IRUpdate:Im not exactly sure, but I tried to charge the phone for the first time, and the charger becomes very hot and smells funny, Im now using Anker charger for my Note 3.Update:I'm a bit paranoid so I install some apps to test it. I can say this note 3 is Genuine but Im still not sure if its new or refurbish, maybe new because theres this app that say it was plug 4-5 times.------------------------------------------------------here is the app I install to verify its authenticity- Genuine Galaxy by xihuanat.com- Phone Info * SAMSUNG * by vndnguyen- Quadrant Standard Edition by Aurora Softworks- Antutu Benchmark X Mar,2014 by Antutu Labs------------------------------------------------------- Genuine Galaxy by xihuanat.comInstalling this first will automatically tell you if its original or notCheck:The Device Model (Mine is SM-N9005)CPU Hardware is Qualcomm MSM 8974CPU Model: ARMv7CPU Cores: 4CPU Frequency: close to 2265MhzTotal RAM : close to 3GB (mine is 2.38GB, the ones in Best Buy is 2.38GB too)Total ROM: should be close to 26.36GBScreen Density: should be 480Camera Resolution: close to 12.78MPFront Camera should be close to 2.07MPIMEI should match from the box- Phone Info * SAMSUNG * by vndnguyenThe only thing that surprise me is the country of origin, in the box it says Made in Korea, but in this app it says it is made in China, no biggy deal tho, how about yours?Manufacturing Date of my Note 3 is 2013/09/17In this app you will also know how many times you plug your cable from your Note 3 whether it is charging or hook on your PC or even you didnt attach the other end, they will still log it here including the S-Pen ( I had to say this is a nice touch. First time you receive your device, install this app to get clues if its been open or not)- Quadrant Standard and Antutu are both Benchmark but lets stick to Antutu Benchmark X Mar,2014 by Antutu LabsSome Antutu application were modified if its already installed in your device thats why it receive high scores to other devices, they release Antutu Benchmark X Mar,2014 for that, so make sure to install this instead of the other one in Play Store.Check the Ratings, it doesnt matter if you missed 5000 point from the original score, it still original.

237474,LG V10 Unlocked Smartphone - International Version (White),,"Received my unit one day ahead of scheduled arrival. Seller provided a travel adapter to fit US two-prong sockets, as this phone comes with a charger for Hong Kong sockets - very thoughtful of them, greatly appreciate it.Have previously owned two LG handsets - the Nexus 5 and G3 - so I have positive prospects with the V10. Have hardly used the phone as I haven't had it one day, but so far I think the camera on this is an amazing improvement from that of the G3, which was already quite good. The manual controls may seem daunting at first, but they're easy to tinker with and are easy to get used to. The secondary screen may be a niche thing for most people, but for me, I can already see that I will get good use out of it. If the secondary screen isn't your thing, don't let that be a deal-breaker for you, as you have the option to not use it.Perhaps the only flaw I've found so far is that the fingerprint sensor is a bit wonky - in both function and in physical build quality. The sensor isn't quick to respond to fingerprints as in, say, the iPhone 6 Plus, and even registering prints can take some time. The button itself, which is also the power switch, also feels flimsy and rattly. This is a shame, as the build quality for the rest of the phone is rock solid and looks amazing.Overall, I am ready to fall in love with this phone. LG is my Android brand of choice due to their design cue of leaving as little bezel as possible, as well as coming pre-installed with very little bloatware. Also love the double-tap command to wake up the phone, the central placement of the rear camera, the screen-minimizer fuction, and really, a lot more. Have I also mentioned this is a dual-sim phone? Because it is.If you're already an LG user, you won't regret this purchase. If you're new to LG or even to Android, this phone is a great starting point, regardless of price.",4,8

132958,BLU S480U Unlocked Studio 7.0 II Smartphone with 5MP Main Camera (Gold),BLU,"Reason I got this phone: So even though I am very well versed in phones of just about every kind (I own multiple Android phones, Windows Phones, and iPhone 6, a Z10, a Fire Phone, etc), I did not realize that anyone had put out a 7 inch phone. When I noticed it was under $150, I went ahead and made the purchase. I understood that the specs were fairly low and that it wasn't going to blow me away. As long as everything worked as expected, albeit slower than my G Flex 2, I felt this would be a fun phone to use from time to time when I didn't want to carry a tablet and a phone. Did it live up to my ""just work"" expectations?I generally find ""pro"" and ""con"" lists very useful when trying to find specific details so that is how I am going to handle this.Pros:-SIM Card Worked Immediately: I have had MANY phones I had to change APN settings before data would work, including really expensive ones. Studio 7.0 ii had no problems and I didn't have to mess with any settings.-Speaker: Some other reviewers have listed this as a con but I thought it sounded just fine for a cheap phone. It isn't extremely loud nor is extremely clear, but it does it job when listing to podcasts in bed or playing a quick game. If my environment is loud, I use headphones.-Bluetooth And WIFI Worked Great: I used bluetooth headphones and my home WIFI without fail.-Played Games Surprisingly Well: I immediately downloaded Minecraft as a test. While it took awhile to loud, it ran rather smooth. I see this on a lot of newer low end phones. They take awhile to load more demanding games but do surprisingly well once it is complete.-Appearance: It looks like a very nice device. Back mimics the original Nexus 7 but looks more elegant with the metal trim. The front gives off an HTC M7/M8/M9 vibe.-Weight: It felt light in my hands for its overall size. Sure it is my heaviest phone, but it is 7 inches!Cons:-Battery: Simply bad. There really isn’t any other way to describe it. With no games, phone calls and minimal video, I can’t imagine the Studio 7 ii ever lasting a full day.-USB Port: Most USB ports on phones have a ""click"" when the cord is inserted. Not only doesn't this phone have the same sound or sensation, but different cords have all fallen out of this phone with very minimal pull. It became hard to use and charge at the same time.-Screen Sensitivity: Too many times did I have to touch the screen twice before it registered what I was trying to do.-No Proximity Sensor: So this partly my fault for not noticing the omission prior to purchase. I didn’t realize how much I would miss it until my face started an internet radio station while talking on the phone. This really should be on EVERY phone.-Video Streaming Issues: In multiple apps, I had issues streaming video. During the first minute, I would get an error message. Once the video restarted, I would have no problems. This happened consistently.-Minimal Screen Brightness Adjustments: As someone who uses their phone in bed quite a bit, I often change brightness levels. Difference between the highest and lowest settings in laughable at best.-Sim Card/SD Card Slot: Using a screw might sound like a good idea considering everyone owns screwdrivers. Big problem? The screw is so tiny that it becomes incredibly easy to misplace it. As someone who changes phones all the time, I am worried it will drop in the couch or something like that. They should have just used a typical slot.-Microphone During Call: I have made exactly one phone call so far with this phone, and I made it expressly to test how using a 7in phone would work out. Straight from the beginning, the person on the other side had troubles hearing me. I had to press the phone against my face for the sound to be loud enough on the other end.-Camera: I hate to list this as a con since I knew neither would be good, but they terrible. They are probably worse than the $50 Windows Phones I have used in the last couple years. Grainy is the norm and unfortunately it stands out more on the low-res screen.-SD Card Support: Honestly this could just be my unit, but my card became corrupt within one day of putting it into this phone. The card has been fine in multiple other devices so I know it isn't the card.-Power Button Response: If I haven't touched my phone in 20 minutes or more, the screen won't come on for a SOLID 5 seconds. Obviously this is unacceptable, even for a phone in this price range.-Android Not Up To Date: I do not give any phone maker wiggle room on this. I am a firm believer that EVERY phone should get updates for 2 years from original release date. Considering this device hasn't been updated since release (as far as I can tell), Blu needs to get their act together. Stagefright exploit needs to be patched.Neutral:-Screen: It is exactly what I thought it would be: a low resolution 7 inch screen that does the job.-General Speed: Going in-between apps isn’t speedy but certainly is good enough, esp. for those used to lower end devices.-USB Port Location: I much prefer it on the bottom but understand that this is different for everyone.So here is the real question: Do I plan on keeping this phone and would I recommend it to anyone? Simply no. My experience with talking on the phone made me quickly realize this is simply a tablet with a single, low end mic at the bottom of the device. Blu didn’t put any thought into making the usability of such a large device easier for the user. Given the phone issues, USB port issues and the SD card issues, I couldn’t possibly suggest anyone buy this. It makes a below average tablet and an horrible phone.",2,13

I decided to try this one first. I really did love it. Everything is very smooth on it. Blackberry has created one of the lightest and smoothest launchers and features. Blackberry hub is really neat especially for people who are constantly communicating over multiple mediums. In the end tho I felt as if I would be happier with a Moto X (and I am) mostly because I just did not feel like I put the keyboard to use, as good as it is, because I have become so efficient with the Google keyboard. I gave this phone to my dad because he missed his Blackberrys of old. He loves this phone. It's basically the perfect blend of all the wonderful things a Blackberry should have with the efficiency and utility of Android.

250654,Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - US GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,"Purchased in early July. This has been a decent temporary phone for my broken S3. I plan on upgrading to a high end phone when one is released that peaks my interest.Update Sept 22nd:Speaker works again!? My hunch is that there was a software bug and Motorola pushed a background software update. You've earned your star back!Time and again though I'm reminded of my camera woes. The distant scenery shots are good, but anything that's about 1-2 ft or closer are fuzzy. Things such as bar codes and QR codes are not readable by my phone since it can't make a sharp image. Hopefully it's just mine, but I have no one to compare. I'll post some pictures as some point.Update, Sept 1st:Speaker no longer works. It was fine a few days ago, I didn't do anything potentially destructive to the phone (no drops, no liquids, etc). It's just been in my pocket or on the table. This likely is a manufacturing defect on the Moto E since it was an issue for the Moto G. The issues are just now starting to appear. You've been warned.Prior to Sept 1st:Overall, it does all the basics that I require and is still quite responsive. Screen looks fine. It's slightly thick while still feeling solid and quality given it's inexpensive price point. Being the basic Android with Google sync works great for me. No extra apps required to keep things moving.Downsides: Camera is garbage! 1-2 ft photos are horribly fuzzy while distant photos the edges are soft. For example, if I took a picture of a tree, it will be difficult to clearly distinguish the edges of the leaves.The lack of 4G compared to my S3 is more noticeable than I thought. It still is okay, but I must not be in a rush to find something. The wireless seems to be spotty at times, which didn't happen with my S3. Wifi speeds are the way to go and what I use most frequently anyways.",4,1
361637,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge G925i 32GB Unlocked GSM LTE Octa-Core Phone w/ 16MP Camera - Gold Platinum (International Version),Samsung,"Purchased from the seller Wireless Place. I would use them again if needed.Phone is a gorgeous Emerald color. This is authentic. No seal was broken or anything. It is brand new. Never been used before.Camera is stunning. I love it. My family and friends love it. I am still figuring it out, but it is great.At first the battery sucked, but that is because I used it so much. Playing with it and changing settings. That kind of thing. I still use it a lot, almost as much as when I first got it, and the battery has improved. The only issue I have so far (very very small issue, don't freak out), is that sometimes when I am charging the phone it will say it isn't charging and then go right back to charging. It can be annoying when I am listening to music or watching Netflix. A way to fix that though is set the sound on mute (this also mutes notifications).Screen is the best I have ever seen. So vibrant and clear. I don't really notice fingerprints on the front but I can't say the same for the back. They aren't too bad, not much there, but it does leave finger prints. Just wanted to let you know.If you are into using your fingerprint to unlock your device this lets you have multiple prints. I think this is pretty cool and handy. I am not an iPhone person so I have no idea if Apple allows that as well.The speaker is amazing too. Such a tiny thing gives off so much sound. For me, keeping it around the middle, or just a little bit over, is loud enough. Unless I am in the mood to have my music blasting, but I don't do that often.The edge is really cool. You have the people edge and the apps edge. You can add 5 to each. On the people edge, each person has their own color. So if your phone is facing down (screen not visible) and your sister (who is placed in the purple circle) texts you, the edge lights up in that color. You can also have night clock, which is just as cool and the information stream. You can turn any of these off or on. You can also have the edge on either the left side of the screen or the right. Whichever one you prefer.There is a lot of customization on this phone and I love that.I love this phone and I would recommend this product to you. Again, I bought mine through Wireless Place. I do not see a pre-loaded special app as a previous reviewer has said. Nor do I think it is scam as another reviewer said ( though he did not provide the seller).",5,3

251870,Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,"Purchased cause I changed from sprint to Family Mobile (T-mobile towers) with Wal*Mart. Came from an HTC One M7, This phone is good for the price. Front camera is bad in poor lighting and unless outside or in a well lit room you wont get a good picture. Back facing camera is decent and will get the job done. Got the 4G LTE model, and even though my city has 4G LTE and my carrier supports it, the best service i get is H+ even when a member if my family is getting 4G LTE in the same location with a Galaxy S4. Do not know if this is cause by apn settings or simply the antenna on the phone. If you are looking for a cheap unlocked phone this is the best you will get at this price range. Very fast and has an micro SD slot that allows you to expand the memory by up to 32 GB. Have not had any problems 2 months with this phone. One small annoyance by this phone might be the fact that the LED light does not go on when charging but this is a personal pet peeve. Speaker is on the back of the phone; therefore, while playing music you must place down on screen cause of you place it down on the back the sound is muffled.

82092,"ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser 5.5"" 2GB RAM 32GB storage, Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Glacier Silver",Asus,"ProsVery thin and light, you won't suffer hand fatigue from holding it.Extremely sensitive touch screen (a little too sensitive).Very fast fingerprint sensor.Easy transfer of apps and settings from old device - even all my wi-fi connections and passwords were transferred.Still has the app drawer - You have the ability to organize apps in folders either manually or smartly. It's extremely tedious to do manually when you are organizing many apps, but the smart logic may not be your logic, although it does pretty well. When you first form a folder, it's pretty good at giving it the proper name. It's easy to rename the folder.It has infinite scrolling of screens, so you don't have to backtrack when you hit your last home screen.Has a feature to prevent individual apps from starting automatically and running in the background, which, theoretically, saves you battery life (and less annoyances for background updates)Video resolution is excellent. Handles streaming very well with no lags or jerkiness.I found the audio to be excellent through my earbuds--deep and not tinny. Sound through the speaker, unsurprisingly, not too loud, but still rich.System takes up 8 of the 32 gigs that this phone has, but still plenty of space for me. Has no bloatware (except the usual google crap), and a very nifty laser ruler--which comes in handier than you think.The Gorilla Glass is truly fingerprint and smudge resistant.Battery life is substantial. I had the phone in constant use while setting it up and fooling around for 8 hours, including wi-fi and video and it still had power left before I decided to charge it, so it will get you through your day.Call quality is good - Call blocking is a great featureConsIf there's a way to make the sd card the default write location, I haven't found it. Have to download a 3rd party app to move apps from internal storage to SD card, but right now there's plenty of room on the phone, so I shouldn't have to worry about that for a while.The default screenshot button is to press and hold the recently used app button and it's on by default. Since it's very sensitive, I was always accidentally taking screen shots. If you don't need this feature on a regular basis, I suggest turning it off until you need it.The default email app is Google Mail.

Screen is good, call quality is average to good, battery life seems decent so far.The major drawback I have with this phone, and this is nowhere that I found in any of the descriptions online, you have to dig for it, is YOU CANNOT USE MOBILE NETWORK DATA WHILE CALLING. These days this is an issue that is pretty unique to Verizon, and even so there are plenty of phones out there that get around this by having two antennas. This isn't one of them. In the past, I've found the simultaneous data-while-calling to be something I don't need to use all that often, but when I do, I REALLY do need it. And I'm simply incredulous that Sony would release a Verizon phone that doesn't support it. For me, it takes this phone from one I hoped to use for a couple of years, to one that I keep until the contract rolls over.Also irritating, the phone puts up a big warning message about not having data while calling (except on WiFi) when I make a call. Every. Single. Time.",2,4
277483,Ofeely Bamboo Wood Charging Stand with 3 USB Ports for Apple Watch / iphone,Ofeely,"Pros:• Holds iPhone, Apple Watch & cards.• USB power hubCons:• Not Stable• Bamboo covering USB hub not flush.• Cord Management Nightmare• Apple Watch Charger doesn't sit flat/secureI got this stand just 2 days after I bought my Apple Watch and kept it on my nightstand table next to my bed. While the stand held my IPhone even it's case, it just wasn't securely in there. You have to bend the iPhone charging cord right where the base of the connector and the cord meet to get the stand to be flat. Which is bad for the cord. The Apple Watch cord cannot be bent so it just lays across the stand. It's a mess honestly. The bottom bamboo cover that goes over the USB hub was glued incorrectly so it did not sit flat. I managed to remove it, since the USB hub seemed well stuck (glued?) in there I left the cover off. the cable management of this stand is a nightmare. I used an iPad charger in order to sufficiently charge both my iPhone 6 Plus & my Apple Watch via the hub. (actually charged the watch and trickle charged the iPhone it seemed). The watch charger will not lay flat in the carved out area nor does it stay put. if you hit the cord, it usually just flies out. I've stopped using it as I'm just annoyed with it.",2,2
388658,Sony Xperia E C1604 Dual-SIM Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black),Sony,"Pros:- Dual Sim Capable- Responsive, doesn't feel slow and the UI looks nice- Phone design looks good, not ugly for a budget smart phone- microSD slot- Lightweight- Call quality (good even on International calls)Neutrals (features expected for a $150 smart phone):- Screen quality/resolution is average (320 x 480 pixels, 3.5 inches. 165 ppi pixel density)- Single core CPU (1 GHz Cortex-A5)- Memory is OK (4 GB, 2 GB user available. 512 MB RAM)- Battery Life is OK (not great but not bad either)Cons:- Dual Sims aren't very useful.- Only SIM1 is 3G capable, SIM2 is 2G only- Camera is useless, very poor quality pictures in most situations. Mediocre pictures in good light- Phone would lock-up if a call was made on one of the SIMs and it was ended before the other other party answered.- Random phone radio/dialer lock-ups (phone looks like it is working but no incoming or outgoing calls)- Random phone restarts- Phone doesn't shutdown after a lock-up, only fix is to remove the batteryThese problems were with NO 3rd party apps installed. Just what was on the phone itself.I regret buying this phone, it would have been better to just use 2 phones rather than this phone. It was bought so we could use it when traveling internationally. The Samsung dual SIM phones all supported 3G only on SIM1 (unlike Sony, Samsung was honest and stated this in their specifications). This phone just like the Samsung phones has one 3G radio which is for SIM1 only.In most countries 3G wouldn't matter for voice calls but if you travel to Japan or South Korea you need a 3G phone/radio, 2G doesn't work at all. Which is why I wanted a dual sim phone that supports 3G on both SIMs. I only found out of this problem while the phone was in Japan, SIM2 radio didn't work at all in Japan. This combined with the radio/dialer lock-up issue caused major problems.This phone was used by my mother (she knows how to use an Android phone just not troubleshoot it) and she had an awful experience with it. The phone lock-up and 3G radio issues left the phone inoperable for long periods during her trip. This made it impossible to communicate since we didn't know what was happening. The phone would work sometimes and not others. We tried several SIMs thinking it was a problem with the wireless service providers. What we didn't realize was that the phone worked for a little while because the battery was taken out and put back in during SIM swaps.This phone caused lots of stress for my mother & others trying to communicate with her during the trip and on her return. The day of her return she spent over two hours waiting at the airport after traveling for over 22 hours. Her flight was early, airport staff routed some passengers through a different terminal she thought we hadn't arrived yet and waited for us thinking we weren't at the airport yet. We arrived early as well because we saw that the flight was ahead of its schedule. We waited for her thinking customs/immigration might be taking time. We tried calling her but couldn't reach her since the phone was locked-up. She tried shutting down the phone (it never shutoff the phone was locked-up). She tried calling us but no calls went through, she thought the wireless service providers were the issue. Luckily she got tried of waiting and a couple of Good Samaritans helped her out, they called me for her so I was able to find her.Save yourself lots of headaches and stress, don't buy this phone.",1,13

197067,"HTC One X Unlocked Gsm Phone, 16GB, Gray",HTC,"PROS: Hardware, screen, ICS, HTC Sense (yes I think it is a pro!), cameraCONS: Battery life, no replaceable battery option, missing dedicated search keyRecommendation: If you are ready to compromise on the battery life then this is a definite BUY from meTo be fair, I knew what I was getting into when I bought this phone. Excellent hardware as long as you don't count battery as part of the hardware!On very basic usage like talking, texting and moderate browsing and with the screen brightness set to auto, you can probably get about 8 hours of battery life out of this.But with about 45 mins of Pandora, push email, games and basically the things the phone is actually meant to be used for, you will find yourself charging it twice in 8 hours. My average battery life on fair amount of phone usage come to about 6 hours. This includes about an hour of actual phone calls, some online chatting, about an hour of pandora and few games in between to kill time.But enough about the problems. The phone has lots of good stuff going for it.The screen is just brilliant. I will not get into the tech specs of it, but as an end user, I like what I see when it is displayed on this screen.The camera is fast as promised though I still feel it takes a little longer to launch than I would have liked it to. Once launched, the picture clicking is fast and smooth. As you may have read elsewhere, the camera is good, but don't throw away your SLRs or point & shoots just yet.The phone is fast and there is no doubt about it. I have done fair amount of multi-tasking on it and it did not seem to have an adverse effect on the performance. But I do like the ability to be able to actually close each app unlike earlier versions of Android.My one gripe with the design is the elimination of the dedicated search button at the bottom. I don't know why it was done away with as it was really useful and I am not saying that just because I had gotten used to it on my HTC Desire HD.I like the uni-body design except for the fact that now I dont even have the choice to replace the battery. Not that I did so with my old phone, but that was mainly due to lack of tech support from HTC while trying to get the right battery.I know people have been complaining about the 'limited' 32 GB of which only 26 GB is actually available with no option to expand. Personally, it is enough space for me. I do not intend to store and watch HD movies on a phone, even if it has a 4.7 inch screen.I also like that the phone came with a 25 GB dropbox account. It seamlessly connected with my existing dropbox account and simply added the additional space to my existing account. HTC Sense has a lot of integration with drop box, such as the ability to attach files in an email from your dropbox folder by sending a short url in the mail (mind you this is different then the standard option of 'Sharing' your dropbox file via email). However, this drop box integration exists only when you use the native Email app and not the Gmail app (whats up with that google?). Frankly, while google is doing a lot of great things, it needs to get its act together on integration and support of its own products. I have seen a trend that new google products are better supported by third party apps than google itself (for the longest time google docs worked much better on IE than google chrome!).Face unlock is cool but a novelty and not so much of a utility. I would have called it a utility if I did not need to press the power on button to first wake up the phone, then slide the HTC Sense lock screen to unlock the phone before even reaching the face unlock screen. There is a reason it is featured under the security tab.I am still playing with the phone and will update this review at a later date with more information.Update1: HTC released an OTA update yesterday which is said to improve the battery life along with other minor bug fixes. Today was the first day of use with the new update. The phone shows a remaining batter life of little over 50% where as in the past it would be between 30-40% by this time of the day. I will post an update after playing with it over the weekend.",4,136

260354,Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked,Nokia,"Pro:Please refer to [..]for a complete review of Pros of the phone.Con:1. The sensitivity of the touch screen is not adequate. Sometimes, you need to put much force on it. Moreover the scrolling is not easy. It is common while scrolling, you double click on something by mistake.2. The phone is greed to use up the battery's energy. For instance, if you only use music player for about 4 hours, then the phone's battery will decharged within the next 24 hours during which the phone is actually in stand by and everything is off. Besides, the actual standby time of the battery is not 432 hrs as it is advertised, but about 200 hrs, not more. Considering this issues, what's the use of all the functionalities of the phone when you should turn them all off to save battery energy.3. The alarm is a devil. You cannot set the alarm's volume to the level you desire. I contacted Nokia customer service concerning this issue and they suggested that I use a tone with a low voice. Although, this answer does not solve the problem in general, I examined that and noticed a bug of the phone's firmware. I reduced the amplitude of my favorite tone to 10%. When I set the alarm tone to this one, I understand that this is not a simple problem. Because, the phone, when starts to alarm, the volume increases from that 10% to as much as the phone can make noise. The next time I checked with 2% tone. No use. Really silly, because the increasing state of tone has no upper threshold.4. The design for SIM card and RAM places are kinda trouble. In the package there is nothing help you to bring out the SIM card. And RAM won't come out easily.5. No wifi6. The one I bought, has a Chinese RAM. While transferring data to the RAM, it sometimes goes crazy and prevent data transferring. It doesn't matter how you this. I tried that via both the phone's usb connection and a seperate RAM-reader usb connection. Well, I cannot expect more from Chinese products.Overall, if you seek some mobile phone with such functionalities offered by this phone, don't waste your money on this. Instead buy some more expensive but reliable one.",1,5

Upon the first boot up, I pressed the square navigation key and was met with several programs I did not launch. One of these was the camera app which clearly showed the face of another person in there room. This phone was clearly used and damaged by the previous owner.

Understand that this is an international version of the phone. Mine is a single SIM. The phone will boot up into a foreign language. Don't panic you can simply scroll through the listed languages until you find the one you want, English(American) for me. The power supply/charger supplied in the box is for foreign plug ins, but Mobile Front supplies an adapter. They do not however supply any directions, so it helps to know that the plug has a plastic prong that can be moved. It has to be moved out a little bit to work with the us power adapter, which was not clear at first.The phone itself is pretty snazzy, but coming from a Lumia 1520, which is an incredible phone, i was a little underwhelmed. The 1520 feels like a solid well crafted device. The 950 XL a little less so, but it is still a really decent phone. The Windows Hello unlock is frustrating to set up, but very cool once you do. The phone is very zippy and seems pretty powerful. It is substantially faster then the 1520. The biggest plus to this phone is the Windows 10 Mobile, which is HANDS DOWN the best and easiest to use phone OS. If Microsoft persuades companies to develop more apps for the platform it will be unbeatable. It still has MANY of the big important apps. Bottom line - Good phone, Good Price!",4,3

330363,Samsung Galaxy Note I717 16GB 4G LTE GSM Android Phone - Carbon Blue (AT&T version),Samsung,"Phone got here quickly, in good shape and was new. I purchased it from Top 10 cells and, as promised, it was carrier unlocked. I am a T-mobile user and had written down all the apn information expecting to have to set up data access, voice mail and so forth, but nope, as soon as I inserted the SIM it realized it was T-mobile and automatically set those functions up. I also used Samsung's Kies program to quickly update the included Android version from ICS to Jellybean (which it did with no problems). Since I'm using a T-Mobile Sim, I won't be getting 4g speeds but if I'm in an area where T-Mobile has refarmed their 3G to the 1900 band (some larger cities) you will still get some pretty awesome speeds. Since this is an ATT phone I was absolutely amazed at the amount of bloatware that carriers place on their phones (I have always used non-carrier unlocked phones in the past). This includes stuff like ATT Navigation (an app with a monthly charge that does not work as well as the free Google Maps included in Android). Because of the amount of bloat apps which can not be uninstalled in a non-rooted phone I rooted the phone, which was simple to do by following directions on the web. The easiest way is probably to search YouTube for a video explanation on how to root this model. After rooting the phone I uninstalled all the unneeded apps which increased the smoothness and speed of the phone.This phone now has 90 percent of the functionality of the new Note 3 at a fraction of the cost. It is still a large phone with a beautiful screen that works really well. Remember, this phone first came out towards the end of 2011, so there is a bit of lag compared to the newest powerhouses, but you still get the stylus, can run any Android app, and have a very clear, bright screen. Although this is a large phone you don't feel or look too funny using it to place or take calls, and the size makes video viewing and web browsing great compared to using a phone with a 3.5-4.5"" screen. If you're willing to invest an hour or two in rooting (make sure the phone works first since rooting will probably void your warranty) and de-bloating this phone is a fantastic value.",5,8

She gets 3 days of usage out of a single charge, and still has battery life to spare!The phone is very snappy, has a great screen, is slimmer than I expected it to be, and comes with all of the basic accessories (case, ear phones, screen protector). It truly is amazing that a $99 phone (at the time of purchase) can perform like this. The back plate comes off, which exposes the 2 SIM card spots, and the MicroSD card slot as well.

However, this tiny, thin volume button is on the right side, forcing myself to hold the phone w/ my right hand instead of left.-No physical buttons to turn on the screen, resulting in only the power button to turn on the screen (S4 is a better design as it is located on the side for easier access).-The power button is flat on the top of the phone, causing inconvenience to find the button every time I turn on the screen. The button also get scratch up easily as it acts as an IR blaster. If they separate the IR and power button would be better.-The sense Home and Back button are not as consistent in sensing, which can cause frustrations at times.-Only two buttons on the bottom instead of three with an awkward design of Home button on the bottom right instead of the middle (This causes user to use the second hand to access Home instead of one hand due to the button either too far from the left thumb or too close to the right thumb)-The reception never gets full bar maybe due to the aluminum cover (my max is always 3/5 even on the streets)?-Takes a long time to fully charge (2 hours vs 30min. for iPhone 5)-Poor quality hand-free as recipient can't hear clearly unless I hold the mic up close to my mouth.*For personal preference: Although HTC One seems to be better than S4 in many aspect, S4 seems to be a better transition for iPhone users than HTC One.",3,14

Honestly speaking, I made a brave attempt to buy this product even after seeing negative reviews but after receiving the product I realized what people are complaining about.Here is my take on this: At about 180$ if you receive an unlocked outdated model with few issues which can be fixed very easily then I would still call it a great deal. Life is a game of adjustment !!! and I actually bring into practice each and every time...I faced only 2 issues with phone:1) The battery door was old, appeared to be used2) The wall charger was not working.I replied to seller and he promptly sent replacement parts for above things.Many people receive the phone unlocked and think that just inserting the SIM card should make it work for GSM, if the phone does not works or if they see Activation Required message then they start complaining. Even in worst case, the phone is locked you can get unlock code on-line from free to about 30$ (it all depends on the urgency). On this I would say, the seller is good enough as they send me the unlock code when asked for. After unlocking, I easily switched to GSM and removed the activation required message.For any help please type in following in youtube:""How to Unlock Blackberry Bold 9650 Unlocking Remotely by Code Verizon AT&T T-Mobile | CellUnlock.net""""disable activation required Blackberry storm 9500 9530""",5,1

The over all design is a bit chunky and heavy, but that is not a problem as I was expecting it to be for a phone designed like this one. The stock desktop that comes with the phone is not very good. That was easily fixed by downloading a new on from the Google Play store. The silver trim piece on the (right) side was bent out just above the power button. It is not a deal breaker just a little annoying not finding a new item in perfect condition. (I would have given the BV5000 a 5 star rating if not for that)",4,3

Was a great deal when they were on sale by Amazon for less than $300. Not sure if I would buy one from 3rd party marketplace. The ones sold from Amazon are definitely brand new sealed in box.That was my original 5 star review. Two weeks ago I dropped my phone from a distance of about 12 inches from the pavement. It cracked the screen. You could argue that the phone is too fragile but I call it my bad. I contacted Motorola and agreed to $100 replacement and $25 expedite fee. Seemed fair to me. Unfortunately the phone they sent me has intermittent boot up problems. I discovered that after a factory reset on my old working phone (albeit with a cracked screen) and having spent hours setting up the new phone. That led to my 4 hours of calls to Motorola. First they wanted to charge me another $125 for the second replacement phone. But finally they came thru and are expediting a new replacement phone no charge.

282186,OtterBox Defender Series Case for Apple iPhone 6 Plus - Ink Blot,,"Ordered yesterday, received today. Beautiful colors, better than online. No problems with the ""gap"" between the built in screen protector and touch screen, If it did I would return it as defective. My last Otter box did not have that problem either on my iphone 6.In my opinion one had to choose the best of what's currently available, I did extensive research online to find the best 6 plus case. There are not as many as for the 6. At first I wanted a waterproof case, but the gold standard LifeProof, possibly being the best at the moment, has problems with the little doors breaking off etc., which would make it non waterproof. I could not see how it was worth the money $100+ for this case. I know they are aware of this problem, however that doesn't help me right now.I have had problems with Otter Box as well. My last iphone 6 had the belt clip/holster break and although it's under warranty and the part is free, they still want to charge $7.00 to ship this cheap, light part which I consider bad business. I finally convinced them to send it to me free (it's the principle), and that was over a month ago. I feel sure I will never see it. In the meantime, my iphone 6 drowned because I could not clip it to my shirt, so now I have a 6+.By the way, keep in mind that one does not have to be a diver or go boating to drown their $750 phone. Many fall into the toilet, the sink, in my case a tub of water when I bent over. I can tell you that the most important thing to do if that does happen is to turn the device off! Electricity and water do not mix and the longer it stays on the more damage it can do. Get it to a repair place immediately. I went to You Break It We Fix It and they were wonderful. They did a diagnostic for no charge. In my case the phone was completely ruined.I try not to do business with companies that try to get all they can out of me. I prefer fair practices. My case cost me $60. Otter Box has their cases made cheaply in China and the plastic parts can break. Although I understand this as a business decision, when the cheap parts break, don't gouge me on the replacement please when you are buying them for nothing and charging me a premium.I chose Otter Box again because I have dropped the phone several times and it did protect it. I am going to simply buy another plastic belt clip/holster to have it on hand in case this one breaks too. This was the best way for me to go today. I will keep my eyes out for better cases. There is a new waterproof case coming out in March called Catalyst. We will see.",4,21

270543,Nokia Lumia 822 GSM Verizon CDMA 4G LTE Windows Smartphone -Black,Nokia,"One year and nine months into my two-year contract with Verizon, I crushed my Nokia Lumia 928 Windows smartphone in a car door while travelling away from home. Being off the grid for five days was refreshing, but three months without a phone didn't seem advisable. After several phone conversations with Verizon (""you can buy a new phone for $599, but it will only be $99 if you wait the three months,"" ""we have a certified pre-owned 928 for $219,"" ""you can switch to Verizon Edge and get an early upgrade,"" etc.), we turned to amazon.com, where we discovered this $80 replacement phone. I sprang for the $3.99 for overnight shipping.The phone arrived the next day, I pried the tiny thin SIM card from its perch in my crushed phone, carefully placed it into the SIM holder (which is inside the 822 phone instead of inside a removable slot on the edge of the 928 phone), snapped the removable battery of the new phone into place, and turned it on. All of my contacts and text history were there, but the phone call history was gone. None of my photos were displayed on the new phone, although I can restore them with Verizon's backup assistant. I had to reload some apps, find and add my wood thrush ringtone, and tweak a few other settings, but the phone is now in great shape. The instruction manual for the 822 was one of the best I've encountered for technology, clear, easy to follow, nice font, short and concise. Kudos to the anonymous person who wrote it!The Nokia Lumia 822 is slightly shorter (1/3"") and slightly thicker (1/8"") than the Lumia 928. I also purchased a heavy duty case (Eagle Cell PANK822SPSTPLBK Advanced Rugged Armor Hybrid Combo Case with Kickstand for Nokia Lumia 822 - Retail Packaging - Purple/Black (New) From CellJewel (Fulfilled by Amazon)) to protect the phone for the last 3 months of my contract, which makes the phone 1/2"" thick and a bit bulky.The 822 was a great short-term fix to my problem without being forced to purchase Verizon Edge for an early upgrade or an expensive replacement phone. Supposedly the SIM card from my old phone will work in any non-activated 4G Verizon phone. I felt better purchasing this new 822 to ensure that the SIM card really would work, and it did. So I'm a happy camper, fixing my problem for $83.99 instead of $599.Note: gave 4 stars instead of 5 because battery seems to discharge quickly even when just using phone and no other apps. Have to charge at least once a day.",4,1

310930,Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Dual Sim Factory Unlocked Phone White Blanco,Samsung Korea LTD,"One GIANT leap backwards from the Samsung Galaxy 3.The screens color profiles no longer allow you to adjust the screen contrast colors. Samsung no longer provides you the option to select from 5 different screen color options. The default setting is midway between color and B/W. As a result, everything you view on the screen whether photos, movies, icons, screensaver and everything else is pale and lacklustrous. My Samsung Galaxy 3 that finally died, would smoke this sad excuse of a phone. This is like stepping 15 years back in time when they first started coming out with smartphones with colored displays.Second major problem is that both the main ear speaker as well as the external speaker are so low in volume that you really struggle to hear the caller on the other end. This problem also exists with youtube videos and stored music on the phone.The performance of the touch screen sensitivity has also lost its edge. Using almost the identical screen keyboard as the Samsung 3, this keyboard is very insensitive and many times skips letters as you are typing on the screen. As a result, you look back at what you typed and the paragraph is filled with typos. Not cool.I have had 3 Samsungs now and this will be my last. The Samsung 3s were pretty good phones but this one takes the cake.If this is the new Samsung performance then I'm hanging Samsung out to dry.I would NEVER NEVER NEVER recommend something of this lousy quality to anyone.SHAME on you Samsung for peddling this cheap junk to your formerly faithful consumers.",1,4

The phone is a beast. It's fast and it's everything I need/want in a phone and more. Battery drain was insane for the first couple of days and then settled/stabilized.As for Kraymerica, well. I don't know how I feel. Their customer service is been pretty awesome. They respond quickly and are willing to work with you. However, first phone that I got had some minor scruffs on the metal edging of the phone. Minor defects, but still, you're paying that much for a phone, you expect it to be perfect out of the box. I contacted the company and they took $40 off of my initial price, which I thought was more than fair. I then also experienced some speaker issues while on a call. It's nothing on my end, but other callers (I've tested and experienced this myself) hear echo and just overall noise. I've read this may just be an LG G3 issue experienced by some and could be caused by an app. After installing, factoring resetting phone after phone to get to where I'm at, this is just not something I'm willing to do again.Kraymerica sent me another phone on the promise I would send back the original. Again, more than reasonable. Second phone looked great appearance wise. I was setting it up and loving it. Didn't even experience that initial battery drain. But, alas. Another problem arose. It failed to recognize my sandisk ultra 64 gb micro sd card. The first phone had no issue with this. After some debate, I decided to purchase another type of sd card (Samsung evo 64 gb) just to see if it was the phone being picky about cards or what. Welp, it failed to read that second sd card as well.Had to send back the second phone and ultimately decided to keep the original. So it was a lot of wasted time and effort that I had to deal with. Neither phone was perfect, so something's wrong here. They claim these phones are being tested before being sent out for sale, but someone is dropping the ball here.Again, love the phone aside from these issues and the minor cosmetic defects. And great company as far as customer service. Can't give higher than 3 stars, though with 2 out of 2 phones giving me issues.",3,1

To start, this phone was great. Everything worked as advertised and I just loved it. I bought this in August of 2009 and in July of 2010 it just started rebooting on its own. Then in September of 2010 it progressed to just shutting down. Then when I was able to finally get it back up, low and behold no service. Took the sim card out and put in a GO phone and I had plenty of service. All the other features still worked fine but no service. I guess the antenna is shot.

213415,"LG Extravert 2, Verizon (Blue) - Retail Packaging",LG,"My rating is a warning about how sellers may be billing this product. I purchased it as a ""new"" phone from Advantage Wireless Device. What I got is an aftermarket product. I have posted seller feedback elsewhere, but I want to post it here, too, as an advisory to buyers.BE ADVISED:THE SELLER PROMISED TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY TO CUSTOMERS WHO POSTED FAVORABLE REVIEWS ON AMAZON.The product came in an LG box, but once I opened it and saw the aftermarket charger/adapter, I realized that this the box was some sort of thing LG makes available for re-sellers. As it happens, the phone is in fine condition, so I have not returned it. I do feel, however, that it was falsely advertised, and they are gaming the ratings system.As to the phone? It's fine. As I knew it would be. I needed a slide-out keyboard for mother-in-law to use for texting. Don't want to buy a whole data package for a smartphone that she won't use. Therefore, this. It is what it is. If you want to ooh and ahh about a phone, you are not buying a ""feature phone."" You are buying a Droid or an iPhone. But for a feature phone, this one is swell. Keyboard is sturdy. Touch screen reasonably responsive. Wouldn't want to type on the screen but ... keyboard.

195427,HTC One M9 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone w/ 20MP Camera - Amber Gold,HTC,"My previous T-Mobile phone took a dive, so I started looking for a new one. 4G LTE was a requirement. Faster, more storage.This thing is sleek and sexy. It's fast (especially compared to my old phone.) With a 64Gb SD it has lots of space. 32Gb internal is also roomy. But there are issues. I'll cover the most important one first.It will NOT work with T-Mobile 4G LTE. HTC sells this device as compatible with T-Mobile LTE. T-Mobile sells this device for 4G LTE, and their coverage map shows 4G coverage where I am for this specific phone. But it never gets faster than 3G. HTC claims it is the wrong hardware for 4G LTE. T-Mobile claims that HTC can help me get it configured properly; HTC claims there is no configuration possible. Everyone keeps asking if I've entered the APN data correctly. I keep telling them I did not enter the APN data AT ALL, it was set by T-Mobile, and I can't change it if I wanted to. But T-Mobile says it is correct. Just no 4G.It came with Android 4.something. After half a dozen update cycles it finally reached 5.1. That's where I stopped, since there were already too many apps that broke moving from 4 to 5. There is no way to disable the nag notification that there is a software update available.Other issues? You can't configure the lock screen to get rid of a widget that wants to use location services (i.e,. GPS) to look up your local weather online. The HTC Sync software for the PC thinks it should become your media player and scans your computer looking for music and videos, even after unchecking the default options that tell it to do that. It won't help manage media on the phone because it never detects the phone is connected.It took a bit of time, but the phone finally shows up on the PC so I can copy files to it, both internal and external memory. It isn't a disk, so I cannot create playlists for it directly, I have to copy the files to the local disk, create the playlist, and then copy the playlist back to the device. Unfortunately, the standard PC USB port does not provide enough current to charge the phone, so while I'm working on moving data around the battery is actually discharging.The default music player has no configuration that tells it I don't need the album covers for each and every Old Time Radio program I have, or to keep from showing them on screen as I select what to play. Winamp still rocks the llama because it is old enough not to need pictures to work.And one final one: the default messaging app cannot be convinced not to convert replies to SMS texts into MMS. SMS is covered by my text plan. MMS is an extra-cost option.The final score: mixed. It's absolutely amazing that two large companies can promise 4G LTE for this phone and neither one can manage to come through. Don't rely on any posted answers that quote the HTC website, because clearly all of the HTC online documentation is wrong. If you buy this for T-Mobile LTE, try it as soon as you get it. Don't wait until you've invested a lot of time installing things, because you may wind up stuck at 3G.",3,1

I would not make much use of a smartphone, and I certainly didn't want the extra cost that AT&T charges for the their data and messaging plans. But I did want to be able to send text messages to the kids if necessary and the old phone did not have a qwerty keyboard and as an old man, I couldn't negotiate the old style keyboard very well. So I was looking for an unlocked Phone that would work on the AT&T network and that had a qwerty keyboard. The Nokia C3 fit my needs perfectly. And so far, it seems to be of excellent quality...I have always had good results with Nokia and this one is no exception. The voice quality is great.

238463,LG Xpression C395 Unlocked GSM Slider Cell Phone with Touchscreen + Full QWERTY Keyboard - Red,,"My new ATT unlocked LG slider phone is fairly satisfying to use, considering that I have never had a smart phone of any kind before and have to get used to the touch-screen. Since I am a senior citizen, I do not find this an easy process, but it is much easier with this phone than it was with the Jitterbug 5 phone that I tried briefly before. The keyboard works well, and the numerical keypad that is build into the keyboard is not hard to use, especially with any fields that exclusively request numbers (such as for setting an alarm, or entering a contact phone number). When needing to use a digit or two in the middle of text, it can be done easily enough by pressing ""alt"" before pressing something on the numerical keypad.As other reviewers mentioned, it is a little annoying that many features of this unlocked ATT phone are not available. I bought an H20 simcard and am using that service provider, but they were not able to help me connect to the internet at all. One complaint that I had that has nothing to do with the phone in itself is that, like some of the other reviewers, I had ordered a NEW phone, and the one that came was refurbished (clearly indicated on the box). On the positive side, I dropped it on the floor and it fell apart, but it was fine, once I put it back together (although the keyboard may have become slightly loose).I like using the task and alarm features. It is also possible to set an alarm for calendar items, but this is not as useful as I had hoped, since when the alarm rings, it does not bring up the screen on which I scheduled the appointment or task.",4,1

205616,Iphone 5 & 5S Replacement Belt Clip for OtterBox Defender Cases,OtterBox,"My first ever 1 star review, the reason being is two-fold: 1) Poor description of the product. I wanted a case with a rotating clip. Although in the questions section the responses were mixed, I took the chance and was dissapointed. The product is described as ""Replacement Belt Clip of Otterbox Defender Cases"". Not rotating is a significant difference to the Otterbox case and it should be stated somewhere in the description. 2) Does not swivel.Updated:OK... I stand corrected. Upon receipt of this clip, it did not rotate. As I inspected it, it seemed that there was no way that the swivel would work, it looked as if the was just permanently mounted in one position (vertical). I wore it like that for a few days and it never rotated. Low and behold, when I picked it up for work in the morning, it was in a rotated position! I've changed my rating to 5 stars. This does seem to be a quality unit. I don't think it is quite as sturdy as an official Otterbox clip, but the last one I bought of those only lasted a month before breaking. My phone fits securely and it is easy to clip it back in (not so with the Otterbox clip). So far so good! Longevity is the only question.OK, so have had this for a couple months now and am extremely pleased. Lasting longer than the last OEM version I bought.",5,3

237231,"LG V10 H962 64GB Ocean Blue, Dual Sim, 5.7"", 16 MP, Unlocked International Model, No Warranty",LG,"My favorite phone ever. Great display, great look (not for everyone-- it's rugged-- but I love it personally), great speed (sure, it doesn't have the same benchmark scores as some of the newer phones today, but I have not experienced any difficulties and use it to play the newest games as well... You can look up reviews on YouTube, just about everyone will mention how there is no real-life difference in how this phone performs when stacked up against phones that are technically more powerful.Great camera. To be honest I don't use most of the functionality most of the time... but I have had instances where the Auto mode (which is great) isn't quite capturing the lighting or hue how I would like, and in these instances I switch over to Manual mode and am able to get the perfect shot. Moral of the story: Even if you are not a big photo enthusiast, which I am not either, and even if you don't see yourself using the Manual mode, it's still worth it to have this feature for those valuable occasions when you do need it.Also, the second screen is very useful to me. Seriously. At first, I struggled to use it, and I felt that I was just trying to use it because it was there and I felt I wasn't using the phone to its full potential if I wasn't using that second screen. But after about a month, I found the areas for which I really do like to use it, and it became very valuable. Personally, I would say the top features of the second screen that I use are: 1) Music player. I am always playing music from Google Music Player. When working out. When just sitting around at home. When writing this review. When using other apps, etc. It's really really nice to have to turn the main screen on just to change a song. Equally, when I am actually using the phone, i.e. using the browser or in WhatsApp or any other app, it's great to be able to switch songs but just giving one press to the mini-screen up top, without having to close any app I am using at that moment. 2) Most recently used apps. I'm not going to go into detail, but having your five most recent used apps displayed, in the order in which they were last used, becomes a super efficient way of going back and forth between apps (coping a link from an SMS message someone sent, one touch on mini screen to enter GMail where I was composing a message, pasting the link, then one touch on mini screen to go back to the SMS to confirm that I sent the link, then one touch to go into Chrome which I was just using before someone sent me a link, etc.). It's also valuable when, for example, looking up something on Chrome, then instantly switching back to whatever I was using. For example, I could go into Settings, realize I need to Google something, so one-touch to Chrome, then look up the needed info and then one touch back to the Settings, then one touch back to Chrome if needed... I even saw a technician at the AT&T store configuring a V10 in this way. 3) Favorite contacts. It's just awesome to one-touch to call favorite contacts. 4) Flashlight from off-screen. Well, this is probably more valuable to me than others, as I work in a developing country where the power goes out a lot, so it's awesome to be able to one-touch to the flashlight from when the main screen is off.The other functionalities of the second screen... like displaying favorite apps... I didn't find so useful. Displaying favorite apps seems like a practical idea, but in reality you will find that you very rarely use your favorite apps at the same time, and you will find yourself wanting to open an app that is not displayed as your favorite. For example, I might be in Chrome, and I realize I need to go back to my To-Do List app and write something else... except it's not a Favorite app for me, so either way I have to close Chrome and go into my To-Do List app. You will find that it just becomes more logical to display your most recent used apps up there (because essentially by definition those are the apps that you are using ""in the moment"", and thus the ones you are most likely to need right there and then). Of course, you can have the phone display both the Favorite apps and the Recent apps on the top mini screen... but then by default it will show your Favorite apps and you will always have to swipe to go see your Recent apps, and so I just found it made the most sense to display the Recent apps up there but not display any Favorite apps at all. But hey! That's why you have options. This phone let's you do what you want!Oh by the way, after having the phone for three months, I tried using it without the second screen (I turned it off), and really found myself missing it a lot. I kept wanting to use it, then realizing I can't because it's off. Which is testament to the fact that it's truly useful to me (okay, technically I have only established that I have made a habit out of using it, which doesn't necessarily mean it is useful, as we all have bad habits, but whatever, I think it's a great feature!).",5,11

She has never been much for apps but instead uses her phone mainly for texting and maybe a quick web search now and then. She wanted a phone that was not like everyone else's (no iphone); had a good physical keyboard and was not too big. At the price, this was the perfect phone for her. It's quite inexpensive for an unlocked phone, looks nice has a good quality build, and as a pentaband phone works well with T-Mobiles strange US 3G frequencies and can also be used almost anywhere in the world. Having a decent turn by turn Maps app. that allows you to download almost any country in the world and use it without needing to use external data is also a huge plus that will save you an incredible amount of money if you travel outside the US. Like any Nokia Symbian phone at this point in time, this is not the unit to get if you're counting on having new apps or features (Symbian is on a death watch and the Nokia App. Store is a sad place) and the screen size is small (although very clear).

She's had it for about two months now and wants to write a review.The phone itself was great: keyboard fully functional, touchscreen nice and responsive. I especially liked that I could set it to vibrate when I touched a button on the screen, so I always knew if I'd made contact with an actual button. I didn't have a data plan so I can't speak for the web access. One thing I didn't like was that the headphone jack wasn't standard, so if you plan to listen to music you'll need their special headphones. They're great headphones, but I hadn't wanted to spend the extra money. I also had to buy a microSD card for the music, because you can't upload music without one. Once that'd all worked out, the music quality was fantastic. It was super easy to set up playlists. The only other downside about the music was that the headphones couldn't process being in when the phone was jostled, so listening to music while running or in the car makes the phone skip. That'd be okay if only it didn't skip for everyone around me too.Another con: I dropped it for the first time about two weeks ago, which made it turn off. I had to plug it in for a few hours to get it to turn back on, but when that was done it worked well again. Then, a week ago, I dropped it a second time (on a carpeted floor, I might add), and it has completely ceased to be functional at all. I've tried to charge it multiple times, I've taken the battery in and out to try to reset it. Nothing works. It's a kind of expensive piece of metal and plastic now.

I don't need to look at photos that are limited to only 3 inches. I don't need apps that more than waste my time. I don't need a music player which diverts me from engaging in conversations with real people. This phone from Blu--a Florida-based company is very functional. Call quality if fine--great volume, although just slightly muffled. There is jack for head phones, contrary to some reviews. the FM radio has very good reception and is easy to operate if you so inclined. There are many settings for the camera, including white balance! Texting is the old-fashioned way and its works great (texting is something I appreciate). The phone powers up from a shut down in just 8 seconds, and is ready to use. There are three ring tone to choose from and three message alerts as well. The menus are intuitive and a little more complicated than you would expect. The larger screen size is very nice and the graphics are bright, even if not the most crisp like you would see on a smart phone.I ride public transportation to work.

I now think less about checking my emails (can do at home or at work computer) and getting sports scores and more about life and what's happening next to me and what I need to think about in order to grow as a human being. A cell hone is a nice convenience. This phone does the basics very well for such a low cost. And, another benefit, I was able to lower my data plan with AT&T and saved over 70 dollars a month! Saving money, liberation from time-sucking devise, simplicity and better awareness of surrounding life--free at last!",5,20
300570,PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty),BlackBerry,"My ""average"" rating is not a reflection on the seller, or the hardware. It is a reflection on the annoyance of working around the fact it is an AT&T phone.First of all, the phone was new (although the box seemed to have been opened previously). Everything was great as is always the case buying through Amazon. I popped in a T-Mobile SIM and a 64GB MicroSD and everything just worked well. So 5 stars.I subtracted 2 stars because there was no indication of what a nightmare the AT&T branding implies. In all fairness, there's no reason why the seller would know this. So I'm hoping to inform my fellow shoppers. The seller did advertise as an ""AT&T Unlocked"" phone, which is accurate. However, the AT&T branding essentially means it's nearly impossible to patch or update the device. Let me be clear: just like with your computer, you need to update / patch your phone. There are too many vulnerabilities, exploits and malware out there for you to just buy a smartphone and use it without ever patching. And unless you're using it with an AT&T SIM, you cannot get ""over-the-air"" updates, which is the mechanism that seamlessly pushes patches to you, like with iPhones. As of October 3, 2016, my device was running Android Lollipop 5.0, which has known security issues, and yet there was no consumer-friendly way to patch it... over the air. At the time of this review, the current version of Android is Marshmallow 6.0.1.My recommendation: if you are NOT a computer geek, DO NOT buy this phone unless you intend to use it on AT&T.If you are a geek, you can search for the firmware updates and download the AT&T branded image (1.9GB), and the USB drivers, and then flash the phone (read: wipe, load new firmware, and completely reinstall everything on your phone).I spent 5 hours last night researching and executing the update and reinstalling / re-configuring the phone. In hindsight, it would have been smarter to buy an unbranded phone for about $250 more and not have any of these headaches. And lastly, I considered editing the firmware update script (it's a very simple .bat or .sh) and removing the check that forces you to use the AT&T firmware, hoping I could simply flash the ""unbranded"" firmware update. All indications are that I will brick the phone if I do so. Is it a scare tactic? Possibly, but I cannot afford to turn my purchase into a paperweight.",3,4

Because of my work policies, I was stuck using Blackberry for many years, I missed my motorola from old. So now I finally came back to it and I am not regretting anything.

245052,Moto Z with Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod,,"Motorola has been through it all, and when they were on the down-slide, they hit a homerun with their Moto X brand. Yes, the devices didn't sell so hot...but android purists take a special liking to ""X"" phones as the software is TOP TOP TOP notch. Welcome Moto Z...it's a Moto X, and more! Also...it's more money, but it's probably worth, just not to everyone!The software is Moto, the design...Motorola influenced! With that, if you are looking for a premium device, THIS is a premium device. Sure, you might not like the fingerprint reader layout, the buttons are high (hard to reach), and the famous Moto dimple is no more...but this is still a fantastic build. The wood panels also feel fantastic and complement the device very well while holding it. The device comes with a back panel, just so you know! Oh yes...no mic jack. GET OVER IT. All manufactures have said that they will soon not support 3.5 jacks.The software is incredible. Do you have a car bluetooth? Yes? This phone will be your BEST friend while driving. Flawless voice commands that are the best on the market. Texting by voice alone has never been so easy. What Moto adds to stock android is incredible. Why can't other manufacturers do this???Moto mods. Mine are coming in the mail. I've used them. Yes, they are too expensive. The battery pack might be worth it and the speaker to some. If you buy the projector...you must have kids or have money to burn! I can't wait to see what else they come up with for mods, but the so far they are too pricey and don't meet up to most people's expectations. Keep in mind, on the JBL, you can adjust the bass up a bit more if bass is your thing. Do this through the EQ on the phone.The Battery. It's good, just not great. This will last MOST users all day, with 10% to spare at bedtime. It's not bad. I'm guessing that 7.0 will increase battery life some. Also, turn on battery saver and the battery saver for the individual apps. This does help. If you are an average user, the battery won't disappoint, but it won't be a major plus either.This is really a 4.5 device. It's a great start for mod devices and i can't wait to see what the Moto line has in store in the future. The best ideas in android are with Moto. From software to these mods, Motorola is continuing major steps in the right direction.Plus +Build Quality (9/10)Mods (great idea...too expensive)Screen (above average)Fingerprint scanner off/on function (Works wwway better than Samsung on the S7)Great Simple Camera Software (Thank You)Best android software experienceMoto Voice can ACTUALLY help youMiddleCamera (best from moto, middle of the road in the industry)Battery (should get you through the day)Whites (A little too blue)Volume Buttons (wwway up there!)Cons -Big chin!Device feels terrible without backplate (kinda sharp)Device is too big if you never use fingerprint scannerLow light photos (Could be fixed with update)The Moto logo on the front (Really???)",5,46

239093,Life Pure Mini Quad Band Unlocked (White),BLU,"Most budget friendly phones have to sacrifice somewhere. The Moto g has a bad camera, most of the mid-range LGs for T-mobile have limited memory and the Alcatels of the world offer terrible screens (my opinion) while others skimp on batteryBUT- Blu has managed to somehow make what I believe is the perfect midrange that doesn't make any sacrifices. I spent a lot of time looking at tech specs in reviews and what I've realized is for the average person, they are extraneous. So I'll avoid those and talk about the actual experience.SCREEN: If this isn't right, the internals don't matter. Fortunately, this is gorgeous. Like HDTVs, once you hit a certain pixel density, it all kind of looks the same. The pixel count here is high enough that you can't see any (i.e. ""retina"" quality) and the color reproduction is on point. Blacks look black, whites look white, etc... My wife has an iphone 5s and I can't tell a difference (honestly I feel the colors pop more on the Blu)UI: The Blu LPM is running Android 4.2 but you wouldn't know it. Nothing about the UI screams android- in fact the overlay has it operating more like iOS, which is very refreshing. It gives it some character and separates it from the sea of stock androids that are usually pretty lacking in soul. Transitions are smooth and operating the phone is incredibly intuitive. I had an xperia Z (returned b/c the 5 inch screen was just too unwieldy) briefly with 2 gigs of ram and I can't tell a speed difference at all. Google apps are nicely integrated and holding down on the home button takes you straight to Google NowCamera: This is an area most midranges skimp in and one I didn't expect much from. However, I am pleasantly surprised. The camera boots fast (you can go from locked to snapping a picture in approx 2 seconds by accessing it straight from the lock screen) and takes crisp pictures with accurate colors. The front camera is excellent as well, taking clear photos that manage to make great use of available light without looking grainy.Sample shots: [...]Battery: Absolutely beastly. I've been using the phone pretty well constantly since getting it so I'm unable to speak to daily usage but while using apps, surfing the web, or watching videos expect it to drain only 10% an hour AT MOST. Blu claims 36 hours of mixed use and I believe this phone could really go two days of normal use without needing a charge. An almost miraculous feat in the world of android (especially in the midrange!)**UPDATE**- After two weeks with this phone I'm consistently getting 2 full days of regular use (approx 1-2 hours of web a day coupled with light gaming and texting and occasionally some music) and the phone is typically still alive upwards of 40 hours after I've taken it off the chargerFeel: The phone is nicely curved and fits really well in hand. It is thin, reasonably light (although not a featherweight) and feels premium. It's always nice when something feels more expensive than it actually is (instead of the opposite) The buttons are placed well and I really like that it has capacitive buttons along the bottom. They are responsive and disappear nicely when not in use.Sound: Good grief this thing gets loud. It wouldn't matter if it didn't maintain clarity but it does. It is without a doubt the loudest/clearest smartphone speaker I've ever dealt with. You won't be disappointed here. The included headphones are also a nice surprise as they pack great mids and deep bass all with a flat cord that won't tangle.Gaming performance: This will run all of your basic games perfectly fine. I've even been able to try out some more intensive games (Riptide GP2) and it has run them without issue as well- even with the water drip effects and allfl. If you just play angry birds and flappy bird and whatever other avian gaming masterpieces come out- you'll absolutely be fine.Data Speed: I'm running this on T-Mobile and am consistently getting HSPA + speeds. That basically means its fast and pages load nearly instantly. The lack of LTE is really not a huge loss in my opinion. I can stream music and watch videos without any hitches, at some point the extra speed is just that- extra. The Blu LPM is fast, and that's all that really matters.Extras! Blu is going to do well as a company because they give you more than you expect. Included with the phone are a screen protector, clear shell, and a nice pair of headphones with a flat cord and volume control. It's a nice touch.Overall: I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better phone even upwards of $100 of the Blu LPM's $220-ish price tag. It's got a lot of character, looks great/feels great, has plenty of memory, an outstanding battery life, and two great cameras.**Also, in doing research before buying this phone I found out that Blu is based out of Florida-another plus! support this American company!**",5,61

It's a good phone, but I like the iPhone better. So today I went out and bought an iPhone 3G. The graphics on the E71 just can't compare. Plus the iPhone has so many great applications that Nokia just does not have. My call quality issue arose from a problem with at&t, that they are working on at my office. It seems better now. The 3G iPhone is quite a bit better than the 2G version I had.Original Review: I owned a 2G Iphone for about a year, and was getting frustrated by the Iphones bugginess and poor phone quality. So I decided to go phone hunting and settled on the E71. These 2 phones are very different. The Iphone has great graphics and nice applications, but is a pretty basic device. The E71 is a more powerful device, with less graphics ability, but is a better phone. And that was my primary need, #1 a good phone, and #2 a PDA. The Nokia excels at both.I like the VOIP options of the E71. The music player is good too, and can use up to an 8GB micro SD card for music storage.Setting up my Gmail and exchange server accounts was fast and easy.The E71 battery lasts at least twice as long as my 2G Iphone.The call quality is the best of any phone I have owned. I am very happy with the switch. I even switched my SIM card back to my Iphone last week to see how I felt about the Iphone. I switched back to the E71 at lunch. I missed the E71, and I don't like the touchscreen keypad of the Iphone.The E71 is not an Iphone and is not really comparable. The E71 is more like a turbocharged Treo or Blackberry. The Iphone has better graphics, and if you need graphics, the Iphones the better choice. But the E71 is more stable and does not require rebooting, which my Iphone did.I also like the physical size and feel of the E71. It's lighter and thinner than the Iphone. It also seems very well built.The GPS works great and is a lifesaver. You can also use google maps.",5,8

390309,"Sony Xperia sola MT27i-BLK Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, 1 GHz Dual-Core Processor, and 3.7-Inch Touchscreen--U.S. Warranty (Black)",Sony,"Liked the call quality and signal even in a building. Camera was good at taking macro shots. Battery average. Build of the phone is average. It came with these smart tags which you can use to pre-program certain commands (e.g. airplane mode and set alarm for bedroom, normal mode and show calendar for morning mode, etc.) to your phone after scanning the tags. Dig the glove mode feature with which you can use the touchscreen without actually ""touching"" the screen and comes in handy whenever youre wearing gloves or if your hands are wet or dirty, and you just simply have to place your fingertips within a few cms over the touchscreen and just do ""airswipes"". Actual screen is very clear and easy to read. Sound is nice.Update: I updated two weeks ago to Ice Cream Sandwich despite some reviewers expressed regrets but I was really relieved and happy to find out that the update made my Sola even better in some areas: resolutions more crisp, camera resolution better, and most apps can now be accessed more easily. Apps that have been previously accessed now automatically terminate after several minutes of non-use which helps preserve processor commitments, ram load, and battery reserves. Maybe it helped (per my updating habits with my previous mobiles) that after updating to ICS I immediately did a complete factory reset to restore ICS to its ""virgin settings"" which possibly cleaned out inefficient Gingerbread remnants and unnecessary old app gunk. HOEVER, I did notice that after the uodate, the phone became more sluggish, call signal weaker, and battery now really bad. I contacted Sony since it was under warranty to ask thenm to simply try to do something about the weaker antenna and mailed it in (my expense) and when it was returned to me a few weeks after, nothing hs changed.I wonder what is happening to Sony.

220938,"LG G3 D855 Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 32GB, Black",,"LG G3, my favorite phone as well as my not-so favorite phone at times. I guess I will clear up what I mean by that. Before that, I just have to say that for a former flagship, this holds its place well. 3GB RAM, 538 pixels per inch, QUAD HD display, 4k at 30fps, specs like these are just coming about in new phones today. If you are the sort of person who keeps up with the latest flagships, most phones today are already above and beyond these specs, so this isn't where you should get the best of the best. However, the price of this phone is lower than most former flagships, so it is an easy grab. I bought this at $343 when the G4 was already out, but as of August 2016, the price is around $220. That is probably because LG has released the G5, V10, and V20 will unveil on September 6th, 2016(or will already have been released for those people in the future reading this). Now to the phone itself.ProsClear screen- now I know this isn't a full 4k display, but again, I don't think you are coming to buy a movie projector anyway. I love the quality of the screen. While most phones of 2014 can watch Youtube videos in 1080p, this phone can watch one step above in 1440p(if the video supports that).Camera- 13MP is pretty typical as of 2016, but this does take amazing photos from the back camera. The clarity is really nice and it isn't blurry ever. The focus is also pretty good and you can get the blurred effect if you use the Magic focus mode correctly.Memory- I bought the 32GB model so I would have room for things, and after a year, I still have 6GB of free space. I would say I am a decently heavy phone user, so I do have a lot of stuff on my phone, but it supports up to 128GB on a microSD card, so my 8GB card is also the cause for my free space. It is a pretty responsive phone, so there isn't much to worry about on loading time.RAM- 3GB of RAM is a must nowadays. RAM is basically memory to help the phone to do tasks without having to shut them down to open another one. I have yet to see myself using all 3GB of RAM, so pretty happy about that.ConsBattery- It does have a 3000Mah battery, but that doesn't work to extend it for much longer. LG focused on its screen a lot, so the screen sucks the battery life out of this phone like crazy. It can last a day with decent usage, but heavy users might want to bring the charger (or extra battery since it is removable).Shut-downs- Now I am not sure why this happens to my phone, and it made me question whether this phone was actually ""new"". If I don't use my phone for a certain amount of time(it varies), the phone will sometimes just shut off and I have to power it back on. It isn't like it tells me it is turning off either, it just is a black screen and when I press the power button, it will bring me to the LG symbol powering it on. I hope I find a way to fix that, since I have had the issue since I have gotten the phone. It isn't everyday, but it is somewhat often and kind of annoying. I have no intention to just buy a new phone, but if Amazon or some other contest gives a brand new LG G5 or V20, I wouldn't mind taking that now ;).Heat- The phone does heat up kinda often, and you don't even have to be doing anything. Sometimes I just turn on the phone and leave it in my pocket and it is super hot and I feel it through my pocket. This also made me question whether this phone is new, but I guess I'll just live with it. If you are heavy on gaming, sometimes parts of the screen get hot(usually its by the volume buttons), so touching the screen will be a hassle too. (The seller gave me a screen protector when I didn't know I would get one, so that's where I question how new this phone is when I got it. I actually didn't even know I had a protector until the bubbles came up.)Vibration- I think my phone lost its ability to vibrate recently, and I don't understand how or why either.I don't think all of you will have the same issues that I had if you get this phone new.",3,1

139109,"BLU Studio 5.0 HD LTE with 5-Inch HD Display, 13MP Camera, Android KitKat v4.4 and 4G LTE HSPA+ Unlocked Cell Phone- Black",BLU,"Let me qualify everything that I mention in this review in saying that I'm coming from the iOS/iPhone world into the Android world.I was looking for a phone that would be a good value without requiring me to sign a contract for a subsidized phone (or sell off one of the kids).In the past month, I've found the Blu Studio 5.0 HD LTE to be an exceedingly decent phone. Opening the box, there are some things included (silicone case, screen protector, headphones) that most other phones make you purchase yourself. So that was a nice touch. And it's truly a nice looking phone. Ample screen size without being overly large. The weight is enough to say ""I'm pretty sturdy but I'm not going to wear out your arm.""Call quality has been great (T-Moblie in a major US city). The screen on the phone is bright and clear. Colors are vibrant. The camera is rather good (but a little laggy). The sound quality is what one would expect from a little mono speaker on the back. I haven't had the GPS issues that others have listed. All in all, this is a decent phone.I think the biggest drawback to this phone is that it's a bit weak in the internals. I've noticed quite a bit of lag (at times) in apps opening and closing, responding to button pushes, etc. This definitely is not a ""gaming"" phone. Most apps run fine but for some (ie Asphalt 8), it just wasn't happening. Again, coming from an iPhone, I'd gotten used to having a bit more RAM and a beefier processor. But this IS a $200-ish phone.All in all, I would recommend this phone to someone who is looking for a decent off-contract phone...with the understanding that it's not a ""flagship"" phone.",4,2
378880,Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,"Let me just say I am loving this phone, I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am learning something new everyday. I really liked my Galaxy s3 mini too, but Straight Talk now has 4g LTE in my area and I wanted a phone that also had 4g. This is a great little phone, it is a little bit taller and a little narrower than the s3 mini, but when I put it in the case I can't really tell. It does seem a little faster than my s3 mini. I have gotten two days out of the battery, but I am not a heavy phone user. I play a few games like bejeweled, a little bit of texting, checking email, as an alarm clock and making phone calls. I very rarely use it to surf the web or watch videos. I am probably not the most techy person, but I have to say for my purposes this is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone who does not want a huge phone, but still likes to have the quality of one. It did come unlocked and sealed, although like someone else it looked to have been opened and then resealed with an official seal. My guess is that SHOPBEST opened it to put in the plug adapter in it, so I could use it in the US without an issue. This is an inter national phone so the plug comes as a 220v and you need to put a converter on it for 110v. This is the mini version not the regular version. I knew all that coming in so be prepared if you don't read the product description to be surprised.",5,28

90124,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,l am a blackberry fan for a long time but now I don't like their poor performance in the telephone industry. they have lack of apps and instead of adding more features they take off the best feature that no one else ever has which was ON and OFF. That feature let the telephone to become on and off itself at the time you like. Now we have to do it Manually and that is not cool. The other issue blackberry has is that there is no an option to control Device Password and that is very vulnerable to steal. The thief all he has to do is to type wrong passwords only 10 time to own the phone then the security wipe will delete all the data on the device. The only thing good about blackberry is the calendar that you can do with everything you want like everyday 12345 and so on you name it. In this case I am only giving two stars and wishing them good luck.,2,2

141760,"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,"Just received the phone today. I was A bit nervous about purchasing a ""generic"" phone, having been an HTC owner now for several years. I decided to not renew a contract and switch to Net10 a few months ago, and shortly thereafter damaged my HTC One X beyond being reasonable to fix.So, I began to shop for smartphones with features similar to what I was used to and was generally shocked at pricing. So, that is how I ended up ordering this phone.After putting in my sim card, the device worked immediately with my network. The display is wonderful, and the camera seems to be above average. I had no issues with the APN settings, but I downloaded the Net10 app that walks through the set up. Time will tell when it comes to battery life.My only complaint thus far is that there doesn't seem to be an option for ""swype"" when using the keyboard, which is a big complaint from me. I haven't looked for an app to fix it yet, there may be one.All in all, this looks to be a good phone for the pricepoint.",4,12

256610,Motorola Tundra Va76r (Locked to At&t) Mp3 Camera Gps At&t -Grey,Motorola,"Just received a MOTOROLA Tundra cell phone from ""quality used phones"". This is the first impression of the purchase. Will update this review as I use the phone.Pro: The phone is physically in very good condition. Some minor scratches on the front and back, but other wise the finish is good. The cover's spring is strong allowing the cover to close solidly. The outside and inside screens do not have scratches. The inside screen appears to have been replaced. The display is bright (need to install SIM card to do a full screen evaluation). Initial evaluation is the phone is as advertised on Amazon.com.Con: The down side is that the wall charger is not for the Motorola Tundra. There is no conceivable way that the charger's phone connector could be mistaken for a mini USB connector. I have a phone but it's use is limited by the charge currently on the battery. I would have called ""quality used phones"" but I cannot find the company, or the person listed as the seller, on-line or at Amazon.com's website. I will now have to wait while I find, purchase and have delivered the correct phone charger.Two stars for the supplier, ""quality used phones for lack of attention and frustration/inconvenience to customers.

244865,Moto Z Play - Black - 32GB (U.S. Warranty),Motorola,"Just like another reviewer my LG V10 went into bootloop failure. It was a great phone until catastrophe struck. Being a power user I immediately began the hunt for a phone with a replaceable battery. I'm on my phone all day and don't have access to a charger. I quickly learned that this little gem was being lauded for it's great battery life and even better, the ability to attach a power pack. I was hesitant because it's suppose to be a mid-range phone.So far the phone has been pretty amazing. Going rstraight from a V10 you do notice the phone just slightly slower and you can notice the screen is less sharp because of the lower resolution. After 3 or 4 days you completely forget these things though mostly because the phone is buttery smooth and the Amoled display is so much better than LCD at displaying colors and brightness. The phone handles everything I throw at it without a hiccup. I mean it is smooth. It just feels so efficient and well optimized. The battery life will probably send this phone into the realms of android lore for a long time. Using it full blast it stills last ALL freaking day, absolutely amazing.It's almost pure android and this was a big issue for me. LG offers a ton customization which stock android doesn't . I still can't believe that you can't customize the Nav bar soft buttons, really google? I ended using a gesture program to get around this. I really wish the camera was better. It would have made this phone a true monster. As it is, it's still an amazing piece of hardware. It goes to show that sometimes taking a step back, lower resolution, slower processor can lead to a better experience.",5,2

Also comes with the car ""Holder Easy Mount"" that attaches to the inside of your windsheild or dashboard by way of suction. And free Ovi maps,which works well. And that's it basically.

That's one of the reason I choose blutekusa, cause the other review said it came unlocked, the company didn't disappoint.Windows phone is definitly a new experience, I have used both Iphone and android phones before, really liked the windows phone layout and responsivness. The one hiccup I have is that the phone won't let me use my song as the ringtone, which is very strange, considering how almost every other phone I have let me use songs from my library as the ringtone.

Initial impression is very good. Snappy response, bright & clear screen, WiFi worked on first try. All my apps installing smoothly. Have not yet installed SIM card (don't plan on doing so, it's a ""mini tablet"" for my son).Pros:Several of the pre-installed apps were truly un-installable. Able to remove entirely, not just disable. Very little ""bloatware"" in general.While the product description says 32gb MicroSD, I had seen elsewhere that it could handle 64gb. The ""SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC Class 10"" card that I already had works smoothly so far (*MUST* reformat card when you install it). Special setting to default all data to MicroSD. Given the apparent support for 64gb (128gb??) there's no real problem with the limited built-in storage. Use Class 10 cards for good results.Don't expect it to be a Galaxy S4/S5... price/performance is entirely reasonable.Cons:None so far, will update review if I find one.Only reason for 4-star instead of 5-star is that I haven't had it very long yet.

Tried not to compare with other known brand name like Motorola, Samsung, etc. I'm using nexus 6, i bought this for my Mom, since see has a prob. With her eyes so this phone with 5.5"" screen is big enough for her to see, gladly the icons are big too just like NEXUS 5 & 6, so it's a plus. but I'm impressed with this BLÜ low cost & unlocked phone. It doesn't have the greatest camera by any means but there's a trade off for the price.. Not a deal breaker, I didn't find light leaking on the side of the phone like some review, it feel solid in my hand.Cons :power button very sensitive and can be accidentally pressed since it's located under the volume button, prob.

Screen resolution is great, touch sensitivity is OK, sometimes you have to swipe a couple of times but that is probably just the screen protector (which was also included with the phone), and so are both the cameras.I got this phone so I could still use my Net10 prepaid service but not have to deal with the awful grocery-store phones. I wasn't aware of the dual Sim capabilities until I actually got the phone, and I'm only using one right now. But the one I am using works great so I can only assume it would work just as well running two.Setup with Net10 was really easy. It took about two hours after setting up for the data to kick in (up to that point I just had 1G and could only text and call), and i haven't had any issues so far. What makes me even happier about the phone is that where I live, there is only 3G available unless you have a really good phone, or go thru one of the more expensive carriers. But this phone gets 4G! And on Net10 no less. The RAM does get used up somewhat fast, but I always put Clean Master on my phones and the included RAM booster solves that problem just fine.I'll be posting another review if anything changes, but I would say this was a great buy.",4,1
130593,BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold,BLU,Just bought this phone and right out of the box it will not download ANY apps from the Google Play Store. I was on the chat for nearly 2.5 hours with a Google specialist trying to get it to work. Everything else seems at least to be working (not enough time to critique anything) now but completely unable to download any APPS. Would like to know what is going on. Def not a good first impression at this point. Having a phone with a major defect right out of the box is not pleasant.,1,7

It also comes with 2 chargers, even tho 1 is international, it has the American converter, the other is a USB charger. Also u can not register it here in America, because its an international phone, Samsung will not register it here! Since I had an existing Samsung Galaxy I figured I could just switch the Sim card n call Straight Talk to transfer my service to the new phone, lmao, they said they couldn't because my new phone isn't compatable, so I have to go get a conversion kit!

Phone never rang and went straight to voice mail but I never got a voice mail. Called T-Mobile and they said check my blocked list -not there. Somehow some the numbers got changed in directory including this person. Corrected number called her then she could call me. After that phone died again. Did hard reset and got it going again.Enough of that nonsense. Put SIM card back in old Iphone 4 and lo and behold up came all the voice messages from the person in question - seven of them. I didn't lose a customer but came very close. Now this phone works (after another hard reset) for everything a SIM card isn't needed for like computer, Siri.

NOTE -- if you click on item today you will see different seller. Click on it a few hours later and seller will be different again. I have NO IDEA what Amazon is doing. I've seen this on other items that Amazon sells.There were previous reviews about BOTH the phone and the manual being in a language thatwas not understandable. Mine came in Spanish. Seller not honest in description of item. See below howto ENGLISH settings.So far, 2 days, I am pleased with the phone. I installed a global SIM from company called""Roam Simple"" and tested texting and making calls FROM USA; it connected to T-Mobile.Works well. I've not used it outside USA yet. Getting connection and call quality will varyin the EU based on country, city, etc. (I have used other phones in the EU.)Call quality / clarity: In US - fine. (my SIM connected to T-mobile in USA.)DUAL SIM ... nice feature ... use one in your country with cheap in country rates. Other SIM use it for yourinternational travel global SIM.Volume fine. (in some previous reviews people mentioned issues. )FM radio - works OK. (NOTE - adjust volume up and down using the center button.)Texting - no full qwerty keyboard so it is texting as it was about 6 years ago on most phones.World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch, CalculatorBattery: Mine came with an LG 950mH .. great! is still showing fully charged.Torch (Flashlight) .. nice feature. Press center button in UP direction to turn on and off.Phone is great size for traveling.No WEB / internet access with this model. I was not expecting it.Up to 250 contacts.MAKING CALLS and SIM: If you buy a country specific (Argentina) or region (EU) SIM then you may notget service when the phone is in the USA. I bought global SIM for $29. Check with your SIM provider BEFORE buying.NOT ENGLISH: Box was in English, I was hopeful manual would be. It was not - it was in Spanish.I spent about 3 hours looking for a manual. I found full ENGLISH USER GUIDE on the LG Australiaweb site. Search the LG site for A190. The model appears to be the same as the A275 that was soldto Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) countries. (the A275 manual not English is on the LG Brazil site).ELECTRIC POWER: The power supply had a USA plug. I cannot tell if it is DUAL VOLTAGE phone chargerallowing it to be plugged into non USA 220V power outlets with just a conversion plug. I will be using aPOWER CONVERTER (search Amazon for 220V to 120V converters). You may need a converter thanactually is a transformer - converting power down to 120v.COVERSome people talked about cover problems. Gently press down on back cover and gently slide down SLIGHTLY - about an1/8 of an inch. Then from the back, where cover should be extended past end of the phone, lift up the cover.INSTALL BATTERY. If you ever did this on any phone, this should be simple. (NOTE - SIM slots are under the battery.)COVER - back on: DO NOT SLIDE COVER UP. Start with placing cover back on to position whereyou popped it up. THEN slide it up the 1/8 of an inch to lock it in place.CHARGE THE BATTERYThe power input for the cord is under a rubber cover on the LEFT side. It only OPENS on way. BE CAREFUL.Turn phone on its side. With the power cover appearing to your left, gently pry up the rubber cover lifting itat the right edge (the right edge is slightly larger than the left edge of the rubber cover). Lift it about 1/16 ofan inch and then swing it up / out.If you get USA power plug, plug into phone and into USA outlet and charge the battery.CHANGE THE LANGUAGE: My phone's language was set to Portuguese. To get to English:1. hold down the end-call button (which is also the on/off button) on the phone to power it up.2. press upper left button - Menu3. reply ""Si"" (yes) using the upper right button.4. Enter 9 (settings) Ajustes Configuracion & Herramientas5. Enter 3 (Language) Idioma6. Enter 2 (English) Ingles",4,192

I currently have the Palm Treo 700p, but I need to take it back because the power/call end button is acting up on me.

209614,LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,"It's not quite as it appears in the photo, identification of sim 1 and sim 2 is not as clear as shown in the example given. Also a few more set up instructions would have been helpful. But after three days I finally cracked it with the help of my global sim provider. When entering a new contact the global sim requires *11* before the number and # at the end of the number (except for texts). That means 2 entries for some contacts. Apparently it's an LG quirk and not a sim issue. Success came on the third day and my immediate tests have proved satisfactory. We live in an area where the signal is very poor and many phones cannot pick up indoors. The LG wins every time with excellent pick up potential. I'm beginning to like it. If you want to switch an existing global sim card to this phone you may have a bit of work to do on your contact numbers,",4,2

308340,"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,"It's not a 5 star phone compared to all other phones. It's a 5 star phone based on combination of price and features. This no-contract phone at $190 (Amazon price on May 26 2012) is a great buy for the features it has.I bought this for my 12 year old as an upgrade to her non-smartphone and she's loving it. Has loaded bunches of games on it and hasn't had any trouble with any of them after about 10 days.The suggested retail for the Exhibit II is $330. At that price, it's actually a very poor value considering the Samsung GNex is now going for $400.Compared to the $150 (Amazon price) T-Mobile Prism, the Exhibit II is a far better phone.Jan 14 2013 edit: There is a Samsung Android update for this phone that rebrands the phone ""Galaxy Exhibit 4G"" (maybe some improvements/fixes in there too but I didn't look into the update). After nearly a year, the phone still works fine but she occasionally (maybe twice a month) experiences the homescreen icons vanishing (no lockups or crashes that I'm aware of) which is fixed by a reboot. The Galaxy Nexus (GNex) I mentioned in the 3rd paragraph is no longer available and has been replaced by the top of the line Nexus 4 at $299 (8Gb) or $349 (16Gb).Apr 3 2013 edit: Still operating fine with the notations from Jan 14 but I'm deducting 1 star because the ""value"" of the phone has gone down as it ages while the price remains pretty stable. The dual core LG Optimus L9 is now available with better specs at nearly the same price. I don't own an L9 but would certainly buy that over this Galaxy Exhibit 4G if I was in the market for a $200 phone.",4,1

Even bigger than the iPhone 6s PLUS!!! It's size makes it rather inconvenient as it can't fit in anything. The camera has surprisingly low quality, considering the Polaroid brand is commonly a camera manufacturer. I had the phone for about 4 months before I bumped it on a corner and the whole screen became pixelated. From then on, the screen had all these little lines across it that wouldn't disappear. I had the phone for a total of 7 months before I dropped it on the sidewalk and the phone wouldn't even turn on again. I understand that phones do break - they can't last forever. But this phone is so large that it's hard to keep a hold of it, and the first incident definitely shouldn't have caused permanent internal screen damage. This phone is extremely brittle. I wouldn't purchase this again.",2,1

It was a temporary replacement for me and I don't think I could've made it permanent.First, the good:- price, price, price- seems quite tough (I didn't try out the waterproof)- grip and size are good- battery is great (but not in cold, see below)The bad:- quite unresponsive and slow at times- camera quality is low- battery dies quickly in cold- eventually, it would randomly just turn off and not turn back on. Not power down but just suddenly have an unresponsive black screen. This happened a few times while it was charging overnight (rendered the alarm useless) and the other times were completely random. The battery would have to be removed to get it to turn back on, which leads to...- need a flat head screwdriver (or similar) to remove back to remove battery. No quick resets here.I couldn't take it after a while. I was mashing the screen with frustration because it wouldn't respond to my touch.

I want to use smartphone for ATT's prepaid plan of $2/day plus 100MB/a day option at $1. At first, I tried to activate it from att website. It went through but didn't offer the $2 option. Then I tried to pop it in my unlocked smartphone and it only gave option to buy data. I was almost giving up and going to visit an ATT store. Then at the 2nd try of chatting with att agent. Problem solved. I went on att activation page and chose the $30 plan, filled in all the info (don't need credit card info), hit ""continue"", the sim card got activated and assigned with a phone number. The I used its associated pin number to log in the newly created account. From there, I could change my plan to $2 a day and then funded the account. You can fund the account with credit card ($10 minimum) or refill card ($25). If you just want to see if att prepaid is the right plan for you, I think buying sim card alone and fund it yourself is better than buying a starter kit from att website, where you are required to buy a refill card of $25 and a $7 universal sim card together to check your cart out. What if yo don't like ATT plan? You lost $25 refill fee.After you are assigned a phone number, If your pin doesn't work. You need to pop in your sim card in your phone, Att system will send you a new pin. That was what happened to me. You also need to configure your phone with ATT APN setting, [...].

No biggie, I fixed it but the back cover was never going to fully fit correctly and the scarred silver lens frame fell out too easily. Then the earbuds popped apart when I unpackaged them. No biggie, I fixed it. Just so you know I have a fine touch and things don't fall apart in my hands, like this phone did. The manual was impossible to understand because it was too far off English proper. So, I went to their website, maybe see videos that would answer my question. No website, nothing online, nada. I keep saying, do not buy electronics that do not have websites! Yet, I did it anyway. As defined online, the caliber of this phone indicated that a website was a given, so I didn't even check. I really, really wanted to keep this phone. I didn't even care if it had a short life because the price was actually low for the bells and whistles. When I can't use the most basic features, the honeymoon ends quickly. I replaced it with a Straight Talk (which is where this phone was headed) Galaxy Grand Prime.

241496,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked,,"It IS a sleek and beautiful phone- feels great in a petite hand. I love the ability to have a smartphone that can access at least one of the four major cellular carriers- including the smaller carriers as well. Any macro sim card is needed from the company YOU choose- contract or No CONTRACT---- pre-pay or post-pay! The wi-fi drops if you're away from it and cell reception is mediocre at best. The bonus micro sd slot, is also a major perk. The screen in large and suffices. I bought the Sparin glass 2 pack, which went on so easily. I also purchased a protective cover for it. The camera lacks so much, but that's NOT an important feature for me. So, my Moto friends, this phone lacks a speakerphone with volume at maximum. It's the biggest drawback so far for me, as my old Samsung had an incredible speakerphone. It's a Google phone and comes with MANY apps for a lower-end smartphone. It's LOADED with amazon ads, but for me, they are not bothersome. This is a $100 smartphone that affords you the opportunity to efficiently surf the web, check e-mails and social media, text, and make calls with ease. I copied my phonebook from my old phone, and sent it to my Google e-mail account. Once I slipped in my MACRO sim card, I was IMMEDIATELY connected to my cell carrier. I turned on the phone and followed all promts to start-up the phone. I then engaged my Google e-mail account, and downloaded all of my contacts to my Moto phone within seconds- easy peasy! I wish I read a review stating everything I've leaned because I would've spent the $50 more the G4 and had fingerprint and better speakers.

197507,HTC Radar C110E Unlocked GSM Phone - White/Silver,HTC,"In short, I love this phone. I currently own 2 of them. One for my wife, and the other for me. The first one I purchased was this one on Amazon, so I could decide if I wanted to switch from an Android device to a Windows Phone. Needless to say I was blown away. I was always a fan of the flexibility of Android, and loved adding custom software and Roms to my phone. My wife on the other hand just wanted a phone that worked consistently. Her HTC Mytouch4G was getting slow and buggy, so I decided to have her try a Windows phone since I had heard nothing but good things (We are on Cincinnati Bell, so an iPhone was not an option. Although I don't think I would have chosen that over the Radar anyway). When my wife got her Windows phone she loved the interface, and the integration with Facebook. She didn't like that MyFitness Pal app didn't have a barcode scanner (it does now), and that there is no Words with Friends (still isn't), but those were small gripes in comparison to having a phone that didn't hang and need to be rebooted daily. Speaking of daily, under typical usage neither of our Android devices would last more than 8 hours on a charge. The Windows phone will go a day and a half (still no blackberry) but much better. Well, as you may have guessed, I gave up my modded Android HTC G2 for a Radar as well, and haven't regretted it for a second. Having your hands on one of these things is believing. If you get a chance to try one out take a friend with an android or iphone with you. Go to Youtube and stream a video, and watch how much faster the Windows phone can do it. It is really amazing.Pros:Slick interfaceJust WorksGood Camera (Rear facing)Decent front cameraSolid HTC buildCons:Windows app market much smaller than Android or iPhoneUpdate 7/16/13 I Sold on my HTC Radar some months ago, and I have to say it held up really well. I still don't think you can go wrong with this phone, especially if you aren't heavily invested in another ecosystem.Additional Pros I left out originally:SkydriveThe con of the app market has been mostly mitigated with a lot of official apps released in the last year. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Linked In, ebay, Amazon etc. Still no Instagram, but check out Instance for a good substitute if you want that functionality.",5,10
376213,"Samsung Gravity T456/T459 Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 1.3 MP Camera, Bluetooth and Music Player - No Warranty - Gray/Lime",Samsung,"In purchasing in this product, I do not think I realized that I was getting a phone that has a few major differences that what I was trying to replace. The description says T456/T459. I already owned a T459 Samsung Gravity that is a simple phone that does what I need it to do (until it was dropped in a puddle during a major rainstorm). I am not concerned about internet connectivity, touch screen or apps. The Gravity has a QWERTY keyboard that slides out that I use for texting. It also has functionality compatability with T-Mobile that saves all phone numbers to T-Mobile Servers as a back-up. What I received was a T456 Samsung Fido (appears to be for Rogers network in Canada). It has the same QWERTY keyboard that slides out. The shell is generally the same (exact same color scheme as my Gravity). The phone is compatable with T-mobile, but I have had the most difficult time getting my old phone numbers across on my old SIM card. Did not thik this would be an issue with the push/pull of the addressbook from T-mobile servers, however the T456 DOES NOT HAVE THIS FUNCTIONALITY. If I had multilpe phone numbers on the Gravity for a contact, only the cellphone numbers made it to the T456, not land line/home or office.There are some other functionality differences in terms of how to get to a certain function, but otherwise similar to my Gravity.",3,1

403428,Unlocked Quad-band S29 Smart Watch Phone Micro SD Card SIM Card Bluetooth Wrist Smartwatch Smart Mobile Phone (Golden),,"In general, it's a fairly nice watch and works with the 'BT Notification' and the 'Mediatek SmartDevice' app. The latter allows for very intricate configuration of app and system service notifications (Android only). Four main negative issues:1) While the device is truly 64M ROM and will take firmware updates found in the xda developers forum, this hardware does not work properly with those firmware: screen appears upside down with other issues.2) This device implies you can set custom wallpaper, but when a new image is set, it never actually gets applied. I've tried 128x128 and 240x240 sized images in both gif and jpg formats. I may have even tried png.3) The Bluetooth utility does not have a ""search"" feature like my DZ09. This means that if you will have a problem trying to connect Bluetooth headphones or headset that rely on the ""Smart"" device to initiate the pairing. So I have not been able to pair my headphones that I used to workout with.4) The pedometer does not seem as accurate as my DZ09 and none of the Android apps I've tried on my Samsung Avant seem to work with calculating the data from the watch into meaningful results (calories, etc). But this has been the case with the DZ09 as well (I tried a number of apps on my single Avant and tried reboot combinations of all sorts but could not get the apps to receive data even though the phone did ""connect"" to the watches successfully.",3,1

145469,BLU Studio C 5+5 LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Black,BLU,"Im rating this two stars based more on the battery and inconsistent volume and notifications. I was losing a percentage point of battery every two minutes, basically giving me 3 hours of usage, including standby time. I turned the screen down all the way and that helped a bit, but that made it hard to use the phone outside. Additionally, the volume seemed to stay at one level regardless of whether I adjusted the volume. Furthermore, this phone notifies you of everything all the time. Seriously, you could walk out of and in range of the same wifi network, say at your home, and it would beep and vibrate each time, really annoying. In the end, I just didn't like it, the lumia 640 and moto 3 2015 seem to be better phones at this price range, and the battery last much longer (days compared to hours). Nothing against BLU, I thought the build was nice, and the design appealing, the hardware just wasn't up to snuff with todays competition.",2,2

Im a youtube account holder and with this app i cant access the different options. and the app does not show all my subscriptions.

I thought it would be different since I'm used to WP, but the camera didn't impress me at all, then, I realized that I'm used to my T2i + 55-250 lens = expected too much.Second impression = still Love the phone and started to like the camera with one mention Manual Settings are the name of the game.Conclusion: in my case, I set the camera expectations too high, but using the camera with manual setting I got very nice pictures (surprisingly good comparable with t2i stock lens). As for the phone continue to like it more and more (521 - 1020 is like night and day).

But BEWARE of fraudulent sellers (e.g. S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices)Let's face it. Someone buying am ""UNLOCKED International Version No Warranty "" phone, is doing it for only one reason: To use it outside the US.So a crook seller sees an oportunity to commit fraud: Let's sell them some $50 used cel phone with a sticker that says i9195 for $300 and when they noticed they where ripped off, they'll be out of the country and won't be able to complain.That was almost my story. Luckily I was able to notice ON TIME, that the model number behind the battery was for an used S7562 (a $50 cel) and not a new i9195 (a $300 one). The worst was that this is a fraud and not an error, since the sticker outside said i9195. They know what they where doing, and they do it on purpose, to criminally cheat us. I tried to contact the seller, but they didn't want to solve the problem, they even insulted me. Luckly, I contacted Amazon and they refunded me the money and I bought it again in another seller, and got the i9195 I wanted (which is great). But I was almost ripped of by this ""Quality_Services_Best_Practices"" crooks. Do you want to risk buying from crooks like these?Read the other reviews for this phone. And you'll se some happy people and some angry ones. This is not due to the phone itself. Some sellers are S***TY_Services_WORST_Practices and they commit fraud to people, hoping they can't complaing from abroad.The i9195 is a GREAT phone, just google i9195 review and you'll see.

I'm still trying to figure out how to get through all of the settings and options, but I'm sure with time I'll be a pro. If you purchase this phone and don't know how to use it, don't be intimidated. There is an entire community of people on the internet on many different forums with the purpose of helping people (like me) out if they don't know how to use the phone, or are just having a problem. Aside from the phone, my purpose in writing this review was to rave about the entire shipping process.I purchased this phone from Amazon.com late Friday night and had no assumption of seeing any type of shipping or processing until at least Monday (I had selected the Super Saver Shipping (5-8 days)). This assumption was based on all other online ordering aside from Amazon.com. To my surprise, the ordering information went straight to the company and this got the ball rolling, fast. The ETA for the package was in 5 business days, which was pretty good by my standards. Using Ensenda, I was able to track my package over the weekend, including Sunday, and by Monday afternoon I had the new phone. That wasn't even 3 days from the night I ordered the phone!! I've never experienced free shipping that was so fast!!! Amazing job Ensenda!!",5,10

On sale when I bought it in gold box lighting deal.Why not 5 stars?1. The main issue for most people with this phone is the battery. Well, we need to give credit to Nokia by giving more juice on N95 8 GB battery after the original N95. But, still...this phone drains battery's power like.... leeches.

I have had this phone for over 2 months and 3 of the corners have cracked off plus part of the edge. This phone has very little internal memory, and it is slow. Because of the lack of memory, Google Play services has stopped working too. The camera is very low quality, and if you try to listen to music with earbuds or headphones, the sound still comes out of the speakers. If you are looking for a loud phone, you've found it because this phone is loud with the two speakers. If you keep the wifi turned off, the brightness down when the phone is sleeping, and turn it off at night, the battery life will last for about a day or two max. I do recommend this phone for kids, though. First, this phone, aside from the cracking of corners, is indestructible. I am clumsy with my technology, and have dropped this phone on many hard surfaces. The phone has only been damaged as mentioned previously. Second, this GSM smartphone is unlocked, which means that you can take it into any wireless GSM provider (Cricket, AT&T, etc), and attach it to a plan. Third, this phone comes in a wide variety of bright and neutral colors that make it feel almost personalized.

When the phone arrived I notice there's dust inside the screen, so I suspect it's a rejected one, but the seller sold it to me as a 'brand new' one, I paid for it at a 'brand new price'",1,2

The phone is sleek, operations are quite lightning fast, the phone does not boot but resets. I think the user interface is quite friendly and there are enough apps for you.I have noticed one problem...it jams once you attempt to end a call u made, and continues reading airtime after that, forcing one to power it off. Dont know if its a software problem, I hope so, because prognosis may be better as that can possibly be adressed with updates. If its hardware problem then verdict is poor as I wont wish for anyone to have this phone. Infact Nokia has to recall them if its that.Another that might stress a user is the poor connectivity to other devices. This makes bluetooth almost useless on it. Thanks. Hope not to regret buying this phone though.",3,9

My company's policy for synching with Exchange server did not allow synching with Nokia/Symbian OS, so I needed to get another WindowsMobile phone. I didn't want to spend much money, and decided on this one. It is a good one. Synchs very well with Exchange/Outlook with WindowsMobile 5. Synching with other email services also OK. Not as many apps for this as with iPhone or Android, but some decent ones. Couple of things to consider on the negative side. 1) battery life not great. I am a heavy user, and most days I have to charge during the day or it will shut off, 2) this model also known as ""T-Mobile Dash""...the model that was sent to me from Unlockedcellphonekings was actually a T-Mobile model. Not a huge deal, but because it was not technically ""unlocked"", I had to replace all the t-mobile settings with at&t's, which took quite a while as I had to search help blogs online to figure out all the correct settings. I recommend this phone, but would also recommend that, if you order it and it get the T-Mobile branded model, send it back and tell them you want the generic HTC-branded one.",4,1
369199,Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920T Gold 32GB T-Mobile,Samsung,"I've previously owned the Galaxy s3 for 2 years and I decided it was time for an upgrade. I bought this phone Refurbished and the phone came in brand new! sealed and in its original package with the charger and ear buds and SIM tool. I'm a full-time student and part-time worker so i most of the time keep my phone on Ultra power saving mode during class and work and when i get home 4 pm I still have 50% of battery or more. The Phone is definitely an upgrade for me. this phone is twice the generation of my previous phone. Whether or not you need this phone and is worth the cost is up to you. Camera is amazing, very sharp those 16 mega pixels don't disappoint. Fingerprint sensor recognizes your finger pretty easily,never had an issue with it. I also love how fast it is when you press the home button twice to open the camera it literally takes a second or less. Also i hope you take care of your phones because this phone has a glass back with a camera protruding out of it so be careful. I recommend getting a case ASAP. Although you can take care of your phone no problem it's still good to have a case just in (case)lol you might drop it one day since it is a slippery phone. Display is very crisp and beautiful. Also to help you fix that little problem with the button lights for the galaxy s6 next to the home button. Get the app called Galaxy button lights to control that feature because the settings do not include that option to change the duration of the lights or to turn them off permanently. - K bye!",5,12

Well worth every single penny. Interface is not as good and as intuitive as iphone, but trust me you'll get used to it very soon. Music sounds very good and the external speakers are very good, could be louder, but hey this is a phone not a boombox.Like:1. Freedom - Being unlocked there are no restrictions on this phone (No more jailbreaking)2. Excellent feature set in the price range (sub $250) - Bang for the buck3. Very customizable4. True multi tasking - Run multiple applications at the same time just like your PC5. Sync/Transfer files via Bluetooth (Finally you can use bluetooth as it is designed, not just for headset)6. Handwriting - I hate little dinky buttons and I can write faster than I can type7. Turn your phone into wifi hotspot (joikuspot)Dislike:1. Interface is not very good2. Installing too many apps can make your phone sluggish3. Horrible camera4. No VPN (Well there is Cisco VPN Client for IPSEC, but just doesn't work)5. Could be thinneriPhone comparision:Well, I had an iphone and didn't like all the restrictions that Apple and AT&T had on that. You've to jailbreak to use many advanced features and worry each time you upgrade your firmware, if it is going to kill the jailbreak. Besides that you've to be with AT&T forever, atleast as long as you want to use iphone. AT&T doesn't let you unlock the phone even after the contract perid, pure insane. Well, you can get iphone unlocked after jailbreaking. But there is no guarantee that future upgrades won't kill that.

1776,"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"I've had ZTE AWE, LG G2, iPhone 5s, Idol 3 5.5"" and now Idol 3 4.7"".This phone is slim, light, and perfect size for the pocket and web browsing. The Idol 5.5"" was too large to keep comfortably in my pocket without breaking it.The screen has a yellower white, which I like better for reading. The screen of the Idol 5.5"" had a bright bluish white, which often hurt my eyes. Both screens are very reflective - remedied by a MATTE screen protector by Mr. Shield.The battery is 2000 mAh, which to my surprise is sufficient to stream Pandora on 4G the whole day. I always thought that I needed 3000 mAh for a whole day operation but the new version of Android is surprisingly battery efficient.The sound from the phone speakers is loud and clear with some depth, but definitely not with super bass or ""like from big speakers"", as some reviews are claiming. Strangely, the ringing and notifications are decreased in volume when headphones are plugged in - definitely a software bug that Alcatel has to straighten out.While the sound through the on-board speakers is good, JBL did an exceptionally poor job with the sound enhancement through headphones, for which I am removing one star. Most cheap earbuds (less than $20) that I tried with the Idol 3 sounded with weak bass. Turning on the JBL ""audio effects"" attempts to create surround sound by distancing/depressing the mid frequencies, corresponding to human voices. That results in decreased clarity and ""muddy"" sound. The included JBL earphones were the worst from the bunch I tried with no clear highs and a complete lack of bass. I would not pay even $5 for those. Only the earbuds that came with my iPhone 5s had crystal clarity and after I pumped the bass with the Bass Booster app, the sound became acceptable and listening to Pandora enjoyable.A pleasant surprise was the back (13 Mpx) f/2.0 aperture camera, which is the same in the 4.7"" and the 5.5"" models. Its Automatic mode takes good pics in good light. The Automatic is not smart enough in low light so I turn on the Manual mode, set timer to 5s to avoid camera shake, and ISO to about 800. With these manual settings, I was able to get sharp selfies (can see my skin pores) without much noise even in very dim light (indoors, early in the morning on a cloudy day). In comparison, the iPhone 5s automatic mode rarely produced sharp pics in dim light (like indoors during the day), while LG G2 got them but smeared all fine details like eyelashes and skin pores due to agressive noise reduction. The pics that I get with the Idol 3 come out with colors close to what my eyes see with slight saturation of reds. In comparison, LG G2 had a tendency to produce washed out (bluer) pics.In terms of everyday tasks, the 4.7"" Idol 3 is just as fast as the 5.5"" version, and is even faster in the animation when you close all open apps and they slide off the screen one by one. The 5.5"" version stutters in that ?! The 4.7"" Idol 3 has slower processor on specs but has to control fewer screen pixels or is better optimized. I rarely play games on phones so can't compare the two phones in that department. Both phones stutter when browsing the DESKTOP version of image-intensive web pages like Amazon but even my powerful desktop computer does that. It has more to do with downloading all the images and the site programming than with how fast the phone video processor is. The occasional slight stutter does not defray from pleasant web browsing.",4,13

I can confirm that this phone is connecting on AT&T towers at 4G LTE speeds. It's a great little phone for the price. It is reasonably fast, and has performed to my expectations. Four stars instead of 5 only because I would prefer the phone had 2 GB of memory, not just 1 GB.

406974,Verizon LG VX8300 No Contract Camera Cell Phone,LG,"I've had this phone for about a week. At first glance, it was so many lightyears better than the free phone T-Mobile had given me that I was overjoyed. Then I noticed some flaws. I'll summarize this as a pros and cons list.PROS - Fabulous reception. The last time I had Verizon it dropped nearly all the calls at my house, so I was taking a big chance switching back because of the phone. Even with 1/2 a bar the connection quality was excellent. I heard everyone much more clearly and everyone noted that they heard me better as well. And, in NY, Verizon has a better overall coverage area, so I was happy. So far, so good.I personally liked the way this phone feels next to my face and in my hand better than either the Chocolate or the Razr, but that's a matter of personal preference. For me the deal-killer with the Chocolate was the lack of speaker phone too.I also like the way the phone book is set up. Everything seems intuitive and well thought out in general.So far, so good, but the cons are a definite annoyance:CONS - 1. Horrible battery life. This phone has a battery life like phones of 5 years ago. You need to charge every night, even on standby. Don't forget to get a car charger and keep it with you with this phone. This is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone, especially compared to the Nokias my friends have.2. Horrible voice-commanded calling. I have yet to get this to work on the first shot. I bought a family plan so my elderly mother could use this - just push a button and say ""call..."" so she could call without having to figure out how to use the phone. I'm sorry that's not going to happen with this phone.3. Iffy speakers - if you make them loud, there is a lot of distortion, but if you put them on medium it's fine.4. Mp3 disabled - this goes under the general Verizon greed issue, but if you go to Ron's review, you'll see how to enable it - and you'll get annoyed when you see right on the phone that the ""mp3 disable"" is checked off. I enabled mine, so far so good.So, if all you need is great reception definitely get this phone. This phone has the best reception of any phone I've had. Judging by other reviews, this isn't the case across the board, but my particular phone gets good reception and has excellent voice clarity on both ends.And, beware, you CANNOT port your number and still get the equipment discount with any service provider on Amazon. However, there is a plus side on the Verizon end. You don't have to get bogged down in a 2 year contract anymore with Amazon either! That was good for me because I wasn't sure about the reception issue. So, I just called and emailed everyone with my new number, which is actualy easier to memorize than the other one was. I wrote this in a review that wasn't published, so lets see if they let this one slip in to this one. If not I'm complaining, because customers should know this before deciding whether to buy.So, overall I am happy with the general things about the phone, but LG needs to address the voice command and battery issues especialy with this model before it will get 5 stars from me. I can live with any other little annoyances.",4,19

Very often overlooked in phones these days.Fits well in your hand.Powerful operating system. If you are the kind of person who can figure out intuitively how different gadgets, computers, programs work.. then you'll love this phone and be an extremely satisfied power user within a few days. If you are less gadgety, then this phone will be annoying for you to figure out, and you should get something more user friendly... like an iPhone or a Blackberry.That being said, the unlocked nature of this phone is a big plus. There are tons of free apps for Symbian on the net that you can easily install, along with lots of free themes, ringtones, etc.Now about style:These days, phones are alot like watches, shoes, etc... Your phone can say alot about you to someone else. Right or wrong, people can stereotype others based on their phones:iPhones are associated with fun, trendy, and $$ people, and more recently with fad based conspicuous consumption.Blackberry's are associated with boring corporate types.Rubberized clamshells are associated with construction workers...This phone isn't well known enough to say anything other than ""classy"" thanks to the understated, but elegant look. The qwerty pad implies that you've got a real job, but the styling indicates you have a fun side too. Its a great looking phone and you can expect to get random compliments and questions about it from people when they see it.",4,1

I only really use my phone for calls, whatsapp and picture taking and because the screen sticks taking pictures is a waste of time because the subject has often moved before the image has captured.I feel like they send inferior unlocked phones out because they are not generally staying in the US so by the time the phone is received and starts acting up we cannot return them. I ordered this phone before and when I got it back to the Caribbean it wouldn't connect to a network.

The specs would indicate that it is a mid-range device, but I have yet to see any performance lag at all. I have played a couple games on it (Madden Mobile and Candy Crush) and have had no issues with them. The version of Android included is very stock seeming, so there are no useless carrier apps hogging room. The Flir camera wasn't really a selling point for me, but it has already found a use when I was looking for my neighbor's leaking pipe in his ceiling! The build quality of the phone is impressive as well. It feels very solid in the hand when you hold it. The physical buttons took a little getting use to after not having them for a couple of years, but that didn't bother me much.This phone is for GSM only, which means it won't work on Verizon or Sprint.

274316,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,"I've been wanting this Windows phone since its release and have finally plop down the money for one. First of all, the type: Nokia Lumia 920 unlocked white International version (RM-821). The biggest difference between international version RM-821 and AT&T's RM-820 is that AT&T's RM-820 is locked (need to get unlock code from AT&T) and AT&T's version support AT&T's 4G network. Since I use this with pay as you go on AT&T network, I usually turn the data OFF unless I really need it (rare). My RM-821 does see AT&T 3G, AT&T LTE 1 Lumia and AT&T LTE 2 Lumia. The biggest advantage of RM-821 over AT&T's branded version is ... whatever updates Nokia/Microsoft announces, you get immediately instead of waiting for AT&T to get theirs. eg. I got the GDR2/Amber update way before official AT&T version get theirs.The phone itself:Beautiful. The screen is bright, the back side is shiny, and it holds nicely in my hand. 32 GB of memory means I'm not fighting for space between my music, photos, videos and apps. It's a bit heavy/big (according to my wife) but I love the weight and size (4.5"") comparing to my previous (Nokia 710 : Windows Phone 7.8) I was debating if I want to pay an extra $100 bucks for the 925 or $800 bucks for the unlocked 1020. The 1020 looks awesome but $800 bucks unlocked (or $609 on AT&T) is a bit steep. 925 looks nice but 16GB RAM is a deal breaker. Most Amazon vendor sells Lumia 920 for about $350 - $360. I've also thought about the 820, which has micro SD slot but with a lower end camera, display and 8GB RAM, the 920 is worthy of their price.The camera:This is one of the main reason I got this phone: the PureView technology 8.7MP is awesome in low light! Go try it at a retail store that has it on display and you'll know what I mean. GDR2 update brings Nokia Pro Cam into the mix, allowing you to quickly mess with ISO, white balance, shutter speed, manual focus, and exposure compensation if you wish. Love the slide to zoom option (even in video!). The location of the camera is a bit too toward the middle since my finger sometimes gets in the way; I guess I just need to hold it the right way :pProcessor:Feels pretty snappy since it was the flag ship phone. Lumia 925/928/1020 all uses the same processor.Wireless charging:I haven't had the chance to play with this so you'll have to read other people's review for that one.NFC:I was looking forward to this since most Android phones can share photos via NFC. I've tried it with a Nexus 7 and no dice. I looked online and noticed that Android's implementation is different than Windows 8 ... so the sharing of photos/video is only possible Nokia to Nokia and Android to Android. You CAN, how ever share URLs and contacts (remember to do the share, choose tab+send)Maps:Offline maps is one of the reason I love this phone (Nokia in general) since you can download the map ahead of time and not worry about having data access to use the GPS option.Apps:Windows store may not have as many apps as iOS or Android, it has enough for me. There are only so many apps one can consume before you see variations of an idea. If it's a concern for you, go search the Windows Phone Store for apps before you buy a Windows phone.Sync:Yeah. People complained about this online because Microsoft is moving away from Zune for Desktop. To get your stuff synced between your PC and your phone, I use Zune to organize the music/video/photo/playlist and ""Windows Phone app for Desktop"" to do the syncing. It's clumsy but it works for me.Update on Sync: (10/18/2013)The playlist still messes up from time to time. One thing that works is: once you connect your phone, it's treated like a USB thumb drive device. To muck with the play list (correctly):1. have ""Windows Phone app for Desktop"" sync the music you want2. use File browser to navigate to whatever-you-name-your-phone\Phone\Music\Playlist (you need to enable ""Show Hidden files, folders, and drives"" if you stay with Microsoft defaults)3. right click on a playlist (something you need to create in Zune) and choose ""Properties""4. Click on the ""References tab"" and it will show you the songs in the playlist5.

400150,Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,"I've been using this phone for about two weeks now. It is an excellent device considering the $150 price. I did return one unit due to a dead pixel, and the replacement was victim to random and frequent reboots (though a factory reset seems to have fixed this and the phone has not done it since).I use my phone mostly for reading so the screen size is great. It is 720p so its not the most crisp but its acceptable.The phone can be a little sluggish which is the weakest point for me. I don't play many games or use any really intensive apps but just switching between Chrome, messaging, and other essential apps stutters quite a bit. I would gladly pay a little more money for a model with 2 gigs of ram (as there are not many other options with this screen size).Keep your expectations in check. Some quality control issues and low to midrange specs, but for $150 its a great deal.",4,8
214595,LG G2 D800 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE 2.26 GHz Quad-Core Android Smartphone with 13 MP Camera (White),LG,"I've been using this for 6 months now, and it works great overall on a no-contract AT&T plan. The features and specs of the phone are obviously not quite on par with today's flagship phones, but its a great mid-upper tier phone with a nice, large screen, snappy quad core processor, 2GB RAM, 32GB storage(no external storage though, good cameras, updated to Android 5.0, good button placement on the rear of the phone with good tactile feel(I like this feature so much that I'm not sure I want to go back to using a phone with buttons on the sides), not much bloatware other than Google's standard package of apps, NFC, overall phone call quality, battery length that is more than adequate for my needs, and the list goes on and on...A few things that could use improvement are the single speaker despite dual speaker grilles? and thus overall quality and loudness of the speaker. The battery is non-removable so this may be a concern down the road. Also, I prefer to have an external SD card for music, video, app storage however this phone sadly does have that capability. This trend seems to be more prevalent in today's high-end phones...Overall, this is a great phone in $200-$250 price range(prices fluctuate a lot) which gives you many features of today's high-end phones that cost 2-3 times more AND I'm positive that today's flagship phones are not 2,3,4 times better than this phone.",5,2

(Model#: X511 BLUE)",Posh Mobile,"I've been using his phone for over a month now and I absolutely love it. Yes, the display is small but it's super colorful. The Google Play Store, lets you download plenty of apps that are compatible with this device.However it is a 4G phone, and my SIM is capable of LTE meaning I am not used to the slowness of the data. If you're connected to Wifi there shouldn't be a problem, and if you're used to 4G data then then you should be okay.It has a 2 mega pixel main camera and a VGA front camera, and if you came here for a good camera... Well probably not the best place to look. The main camera typically gets the job done however.With 4GB of internal memory, adding an SD card is a good idea especially if you love music and lots of apps. I haven't used very much of the data so I don't have many complaints.The charger is mini USB but the metal part of the charger that connects to the phone is a tad longer than your average USB so don't break it or lose it.Overall it's a very good media player and I don't regret purchasing it. I hope this review helps!",5,3
67415,Apple iPhone 6s Plus 128 GB International Warranty Unlocked Cellphone - Retail Packaging (Gold),Apple,"I've been on Android forever and this is my first iPhone... I love it! I was nervous to switch from my beloved Samsungs, but I don't regret this at all. It took a day or two to get adjusted to navigating the phone, but that is to be expected. I still reach for my back button lol. I just wanted a phone that is reliable and doesn't glitch out... and for some reason I wasn't impressed by the edge screens on the new flagship Galaxy phones. I figured it would be a good time to buy an iPhone since the release of the iPhone 7 caused the price to drop on older models.With iOS 10 installed, I don't feel like I'm wanting to instantly go back to my android. The display is beautiful even compared to the super amoled displays on other phones. They are both gorgeous in their own ways, and the 6+ is still very bright, colorful, and crisp. Everything is very fluid, beautiful to navigate, and the apps are so nice to look at! This phone just works. I'm impressed with the battery life as well and I hope this phone lasts for a while.",5,5

235775,"LG Optimus L9 P769, 4G (T-Mobile)",,"I'm with T-Mobile and needed a new phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini international phone(great phone by the way), but it doesn't have WIFI calling (only T-Mobile branded phones do) and that feature is very important to me. I got the LG Optimus L9 and gave the Samsung to my wife. Here is my review.It's what's called a mid-level phone. The high-level phones have faster processors, better screens, more memory, 4G LTE, features like auto-brightness - the list goes on. My take on this phone? I love it.The screen is great. It's sharp and touches, drags, and scrolls are very smooth. It has T-Mobile's old 4G data, which is really HPSA+. It's plenty fast for me and supposedly, HPSA+ doesn't drain your battery as fast as LTE. Speaking of batteries, this phone has a great one. Poor battery life is one of the knocks on this phone, but once I disabled all the bloatware wakelocks. it lasts all day and typically has 80%-90% left.Speaking of bloatware, this phone is loaded. Every product Google ever made for phones is on it, along with a ton of T-Mobile ...stuff. I took them off the desktop and disabled their access to the Internet where possible and it's fine, but if it really bothers you, root it and do away with them completely.Call quality is excellent on both ends of the call whether using the phone microphone or a headset. The external speaker isn't the best, but it's good enough for calls, and I don't use it for anything else. The processor isn't as fast as the ones in more expensive phones, but I'm not crunching databases here, I'm making calls, checking my email, and occasionally browsing the Internet. It's plenty fast for that.I I was worried about listening to music with the L9, but using Poweramp and my Klipsch earbuds, it actually sounds clearer than it did with the Galaxy.One thing you'll notice if you buy this phone is the Optimus theme wallpaper is awful and there are only 4 themes. If you don't like the choices, you can always use a favorite picture, and there are plenty of themes and wallpaper available on Google Play. I went with a solid,dark blue background.I bought this phone because it was 1/3 the price of the high end phones, but I don't think I'm missing anything. It's as good for my purposes as any phone I have owned. Highly recommended.",4,1

The camera is superb and I'm getting all 4 bars on my T-Mobile Carrier in the Boston area which was the one thing that I was afraid when purchasing this phone.

I got mine from Mobicity. The phone came in dutch, but I was quickly able to switch it to english by using the google translator and selecting the right options. I configured the phone--amazingly, the Windows 8 tablet I have doesn't support POP accounts, but the phone does--had to migrate my contacts to the hotmail account to get them on the phone.I used to be a blackberry user, and it was a little painfull to switch and migrate the data. Windows Phone 8 consolidates all accounts and contacts in the people tile and it takes some time to get used to this. I use whatsapp for chatting and there are some options in blackberry that are not found in the Windows Phone version, such as adding a number to an existing contact. One thing that I trying to do with it is change the tile's color, not all of them but individually. For example, I have 4 email accounts and I would like to differentiate one from the others, but tiles can all change from color not individually.Another thing is that the volume buttons control all volumes at the same time, including ring, speaker, notifications, alarms, etc.Still, this phone rocks. When I take it to meetings, people stare a it. It takes the best pictures with low light I've ever seen. The grip is a little slippery. It has gotten away from my hands on 2 ocassions already and I'm actively looking for a cover.Office experience is great, gravity sensor is a little slow as it needs the phone to be at a given angle before it will tilt the screen.",4,12

No need for a case on this one also as the unibody design is solid, grippy and apparently you can pound nails with the Gorilla Glass 2 screen and not damage the phone. Nice to be able to have a phone that I can throw in my pocket 'naked' and not have to worry about it.The latest firmware update from AT&T last week addressed a bunch of issues and now wifi & bluetooth work without a hitch and the battery lasts alllll day. Knowing that HTC has already committed to bring Android 4.2.2 and Sense 5 with Blinkfeed to this phone in June/July eases my obsolescence fears a bit.If you are interested in this phone be sure to go to an AT&T store to try one out. The feel of it in your hand is unlike any other.Highly recommended. Oh, I bought it on Amazon from the seller Mobile Image and they were great. Shipped it quick, identified it properly and addressed all my post sale questions promptly.",5,9

80871,"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black",Asus,"I'm a T-Mobile customer and I purchased my iPhone 6+ from them on their monthly payment plan... I wanted to get rid of the payment plan so, I figured I would try this phone and see if it could be used to replace my iPhone for my needs (For the record, I'm not a huge Apple or Google fan these days but, Microsoft's platform has too many issues).DAILY USAGE My daily smartphone usage includes, surfing the web, reading emails, texting, using Waze, playing a few games, and taking a few pictures. For these tasks, I find the phone handles them quite well.BATTERY LIFE This area is a bit of a stumbling block in that the battery is 3000 mAh and yet you can run through it in 9 hours if you use it heavily as I do. For me, I keep a charger in my car and I use that when I'm using Waze so, I just have to make it through the work day and then the phone will be partially recharged on the way home so, it isn't a big deal as far as my daily usage is concerned. Also, I suspect it will get better the less I play with the phone as I've been checking out all the features for the first few days of owning it.PERFORMANCE With 2 Gigs of RAM and an Intel Quad Core CPU, this puppy is smooth! I literally haven't experienced a slow down at all and cannot believe how well Asus has done with optimizing the phone. Literally, jumping from screen to screen or app to app has been no issue at all as it remains quick and fluid throughout the day.CAMERA This is an area where many people have complaints but, I actually like the camera a lot and I find the quality of the images to be very solid. I tend to bring them into the Windows 8 photo app and just do an auto-correction (with one of the 5 auto-correction options and they turn out better than my iPhone delivers). Now, with that said the camera can produce some nice images but, it is in no way optimized for this so, if you want the simple dumb down interface and high quality photos you get from the iPhone then you should probably pay the extra $400 and buy the iPhone.The biggest strength of the camera is in how flexible it is... You can literally adjust White Balance in 100K Intervals starting at 2500 Kelvin and there's an almost 100% manual mode that allows you to set everything but the Aperture (It is more like Aperture Priority) and this works quite well if you ask me.I've uploaded 5 photos I've taken using the camera and auto-correcting in Windows Photo app.NETWORK AND WIFI The radios in the camera have been great so far, I get LTE 4G from TMO and my Wireless N connection is also very quick.BLOATWARE This is the one downside to the phone, Asus puts a ton of their own software on this thing. Honestly I don't think it is any worse than Apple on the iPhone because it is pretty much all Asus Software but, I wish you had an option to remove it and not just disable it.ZEN UI The UI isn't bad but, I still replaced the stock keyboard with the Google Keyboard and the stock Launcher with the Google Now Launcher so I could get it mostly back to the stock Android behavior and it has worked out really well for me so far.CONCLUSION This is really a great product for the money and I'm really impressed with it. I can pretty much do anything I could do with the iPhone and then some so, I believe this is going to help me sell my iPhone and get rid of that $40 monthly bill for the phone.If you're looking for a really nice phone or fone for under $200, this phone is really tough to beat!",4,213

300572,PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty),BlackBerry,"I'm a blackberry fan and since I cracked my screen of my passport, I went ahead and replaced it with priv. The phone is nice. It was suppose to be delivered by fedex at certain, it did not. No fault of the seller. FedEx service in my residential area is unsatisfactory. However, when I opened the boxed I noticed that it was in AT&T packaging, booted up with an AT&T mobile log and has a AT&T logo on the back of the phone. And upon further review it has AT&T apps loaded that you cannot delete. So this is truly not a factory unlocked phone from blackberry but an unlocked AT&T blackberry priv. The description should say that. I use TMO as my carrier and now I have unnecessary applications taking up memory space on my phone. I'm planning on sending it back because I wanted a TRUE unlocked blackberry phone. Please update your description to indicate that this is a AT&T unlocked carrier phone. Even though my TMO sim works fine, I have to deal with the AT&T loaded apps, software and settings.",3,6

I've enjoyed using my LG flip phone for several years. It's user friendly, has an actual keyboard for texting, but still is current with Google, e-mail, etc. Got tired of young folks laughing at my ""old"" phone, so I decided to get with the century and get a Smart Phone. Determined to find one with a real keyboard, I stumbled on this Motorola Photon Q. Looked like just what I needed...an easy way to transition into the touch screen world while having a keyboard crutch!! Well, I ordered it and I was so excited when it arrived. Took me two weeks to get the nerve to activate it...LOL. I activated it on a Wed afternoon, spent all day and night figuring stuff out, made calls, text...was doing well. Thurs morning, it wouldn't let me text or make phone calls!! Went to 2 Sprint stores, they couldn't figure out why it froze. Put it on their diagnostic machine, no clue. I finally gave them my old flip phone and told them to put it back the way it was. I am disappointed that the phone didn't work and am certainly sending it back. I hope to not have any difficulty getting a full refund. As for my trip into the future of Smart phones? I'm back into the past with my flip phone and will stay there as long as I can.",2,1

They offer a 32 gb galaxy or note with an added option for a memory card and you can replace the battery which sets it aside from iPhone and in my opinion makes it just a little better . With the new release of the s6 I was expected the same amazing capabilities till I impulse bought it and received it only to find out it had none of the previous things that made it great. It has an amazing camera but taking away the memory card capabilities and removable back cover really just makes this feel like an iPhone to me. It even has the sim card removed like an iphone.

It takes 3x longer to do anything you need to do on this phone. The keyboard is not responsive and poorly calibrated, the speakers aren't great, and there are no compatible apps that compare to Motorola assist. Making phone calls takes about three extra steps, and I rarely am able to make or receive calls due to poor reception. I would blame that on the phone service company, but my boyfriend and I are on a family plan and he gets reception when I don't.

258428,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Mint (U.S. Warranty),,"I would like to note first that this is not a Flagship device, but for the class of phone that this falls in it is perfect!. The big selling point for this is the 100GB of instant cloud storage for media and app (which is unique to this device). The 32GB of on board storage is plenty for most users and having the cloud backup makes it a bit more than just having 32GB. It is very snappy and in my use of the device is was smooth with no stuttering or slow downs. It works great with basic games, but I don't think that this for someone who enjoys playing any graphics intensive games. My favorite feature is the look! It is different from any other device that I have owned and feels extremely premium and durable. The camera is average, but I wouldn't have noticed a difference if I hadn't been using a higher end phone camera prior to this one.

Wifi works great, and the Bluetooth is one of the best I've ever had, never lost connection while my phone is in my pocket.

Overall I think it's a good package for the price. Three problems I have which may warrant its return are the fact that I can't get a LTE Signal on StraightTalk (AT&T Network - could be SIM card related; still investigating), can't get it to pair with my 2012 Ford F-150 Sync System (non-touch screen version) and can't get the swipe function on the keyboard to work. A vivid, bright screen, decent speakers and low price can't make up for basic functionality I rely on everyday. I'll mess around with it some more but will likely return if I can't get these features to work. I'm coming from a Google/LG Nexus 4 that took a bath in a lake and I'm missing that phone already. I do find the Idol 3 to have more lag than my Nexus 4, which was running KitKat, not Lollipop.Update: Turned out that the Bluetooth pairing problem was on the Sync end. Following a master reset of Sync the phone paired effortlessly for both phone and media audio. Haven't tried text to speech yet though. I downloaded the Google Keyboard app and swipe function has been restored. Apparently it is a well documented issue that the stock keyboard app doesn't support swipe gestures. I've upped the review to 4-stars. A little more processing performance & less lag would garner a 5 star rating.",4,2

There is no ""open link"" option.- When opening the phonebook, sometimes the phone gets freezed and it restarts itself (maybe a flaw in my particular unit).- When turning on the phone, I ALWAYS get a message on the screen that an application couldn't be installed, but there is not details, I mean, the error won't say what application is having the installation error nor a suggested solution for it.

I checked the specs, decided it was sufficient for what I wanted, and received relatively quick shipping. Since then, it has been nothing but disappointment. I should have paid more attention to the fact that the majority of posted reviews were out of India, and I had never even heard of this model. It doesn't seem to be used in the US much at all. The phone is slow and buggy, takes several seconds for the screen to turn on or off, and it beeps every 3 minutes while charging (I've timed it). It takes several seconds before processing anything, from sending a text message to opening Facebook. As Louis CK said, yes, we should be astonished and amazed at the fact that we can speak to somebody across the country and access data from around the world (so how dare I complain that it takes a few seconds), but when spending a good chunk of money, these issues are mostly non existent in comparable products. Therefore, I regret the purchase and would not recommend it to anybody that I know, or to the strangers here on Amazon. Thought it was a great deal and outsmarted myself.

It came on my Birthday so it was a nice gift. I ordered the gold one which I absolutely loved. The reviews and description boost about its long battery life and quick charging. I un-packaged it at 75%. Started to set it up, adding my gmail account, setting alarms. Just the basics. Took me about 30 min. At that time the battery level had dropped to 22%. Since it was right out of the box I decided to charge it. I used the charger that came with it. It was late so I set it on the dresser and went to bed. In the morning I checked it and it was at 66%. I didn't understand. It was supposed to charge completely in 10 min. After that I had to have it on the charger constantly. The screen started to freeze before the end of the same day.

Motorola SLVR. Key was unlocked quadband, portable (i.e. SIM can be switched easy), light, small, and decent battery life.For email I use my iPod Touch and that is great. The new phone could be helping with that, too, i.e. smartphone so I would forgo the iTouch.I knew the iPhone is the best smartphone out there but Apple keeps p!@# me off with the micro Sim and locking (even if jailbroken, the micro SIM is limiting, cannot cut the big foreign SIMs). I would have bought that long ago if I could travel with it (no,I will not pay for international roaming, nor I have data plan). Also, having to recharge (and carry the charger) all the time does not suit when you are on a bus in Asia or Europe.Once I knew I need a separate device, anyway (Touch) small size became greater factor.Pros:- does exactly what I had: phone, can check email (after some hassle, on IMAP), can check stock quotes, can check Word an Excel (that needs application registration).- battery life is certainly better then the touch on wifi (browsing, email, talk, roughly 3 days span, perhaps 6-7 hrs altogether). I do not know standby: i use the phone.- size: barely bigger than the SLVR and packs much more.Cons:- does not do more than what I had before. The smarts are not enough to forgo carrying my laptop (when I have room) or touch (when I take my two year old and wish not to fumble with the bags through int'l borders).- the BB products use data plan (sorry, that is a no). I found a freeware email client for wifi and Opera mini is a better browser but seriously. My company does not pay for my usage.- I went for the QWERTY, try if works on the 2-for-1 key. Well, it does but not the greatest. Could have bought the regular phone keys (9105) and use T9. works, but for a phone no need.- I did NOT get the 2GB micro SD that should have been included (according all to all sites). Not missing too much but hey. Would have used for saving documents (this is a business phone).Star off for:- forcing data plan (BB specific). The 3rd party products available do not support embedded html email.- downloaded BB Maps (it has GPS, wonder how this works). the BB application simply does not launch. From the BB site. I will never know the GPS works?all this should be intuitive. I will google/etc to solutions but this should not take the better part of my week.

But i wanted a very sexy phone too... so after a lot of research, i found this one that fitted my needs and surpassed my expectations. To begin i dont like ""phones"" with huuuuuge displays, cause the are... logically... HUGE!!! To me they are unconmfortable to hold and operate... and i planned to spend 300$ tops and demonstrate that a very useful phone can cost less than 400$... and this one did it! The 4 inches screen is awesome... very sharp, very coforful, crystal clear, awesomely bright, the whites are outstanding, the blacks not so much but is really decent, good contrast at all!!! The speed is so good, even after the ICS update. Runs smooth. The overall performance is great. The camera takes very good pictures, beyond ""acceptable"". The only cons i have to say (and i don't blame the phone byt the software) is cause after updating the phone, appeared many lags and rebooting troubles, even when after 1 minute the phone gets stable again, this is a pain, but i hope the recently announced upgrade to JB fixes this bugs. I truly recommend this phone so far. If you are on a budget, go for it! Won't regret it! Now it's a little bit cheaper.. around 280$.

Reception is not between the best and old nokia phones out perform this cell. The stainless steel case is prone to dents and a classic Polycarbonate/ABS case is actually sturdier than this fancy enclosure. Overall a very functional slim cool phone but not happy with reliability.UPDATE.Nokia fixed my phone in a week under warranty and I did not pay even shipping. The phone is working great since then and reception appears to be improved.UPDATE 2.After 8 months the display has been replaced it does not respond again but this time the warranty is expired and the cellphone is ready for the trashcan. This is the problem: in a hot humid environment (as a common hot day of Summer) water will diffuse into the display from the edge. This is the area where the display will first stop working.

From reading various reviews the E72 offered a much faster processor but the E71 was almost $100 cheaper and the reviews were very good. So I decided to buy the E71 over the E72 and save some money.So far, I am very happy with the E71. The interface is very user friendly and most of the features are easily usable. I like the feature where you calendar entries for the day and reminders/memos etc are displayed on the main screen so you kind of see them every time you look at the phone serving as a reminder of things to get done for the day.I had a lot of issues initially with the GPS navigation but after doing some research online I figured it out. Basically, I have not signed up for the data plan since I used a pre-paid T-mobile sim card in this phone. Initially it used to take ages (30 minutes plus) to get a satellite signal. Then I went through various settings and disabled the positioning based on AGPS (which requires a data plan) and Blue Tooth leaving only the GPS and Network items checked. Now the phone picks up GPS signals in a few mins. I guess since I had the AGPS checked of, it was trying to position itself by connecting to the GPRS network of T-mobile. The software needs to be made smarter to give up after trying a couple of times and use just the internal GPS receiver for tracking the position. Now that I have only GPS and Network based positioning enabled, it is working just fine. I have compared the directions given by Nokia OVI maps with the built-in GPS in my Honda Pilot and a Garmin unit and the directions are generally the same in all units. I have been using the GPS feature in this phone to navigate around New Jersey and it works fine. The other beauty of this navigation is that maps are free so if you plan to take a weekend trip to France, you can just download the maps for France and delete them after your trip. You need to install the Nokia OVI suite to download the maps. And when you are installing the maps to your phone better to connect with the USB cable than through blue tooth as it will take much longer to transfer map files through blue tooth connection.The calendar/reminder/memo feature is very easy to use. The thing that I noticed though was Nokia OVI suite doesn't have a build in calendar like the Nokia PC suite, I have in my older laptop. Hence you cannot view your calendar on your PC unless you have Microsoft Outlook installed.Overall, I am very happy with the phone. The Otter Box sleve that I ordered with the phone fits perfectly as well. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a smart phone.",5,3

I wanted a Nokia smartphone so badly that I couldn't wait for the n900. However this will be my last Nokia product. Best said on the forums ""$700 and you too can become a beta tester for Nokia."" I spent a month trying to workaround all the bugs and kinks. The second firmware upgrade did help in that the charger stopped draining the battery and crashes were much more rare. I never got the hang of answering the phone and touching the device without setting off the camera proved imposable. Then the screen broke at day 31. Nokias support has taken a nose dive and told me it would be a month to check it out. However I found a workaround with recalibrating the screen. Sick of the bugs I gave it away to someone who's HTC phone broke. His opinion toned down my hatred of this phone saying it's a great phone for free but paying for the phone makes the quality unacceptable.Pros.-With the warranty GPS upgrade OVI maps 3.0 is fantastic. It stores locally and replaces the need for a Garmin when on buiness trips.- With the warranty lens cover upgrade the camera takes pictures beyond any other phone.- If you delete all the stock apps and reinstall on the 32 gig phone area the multi tasking is flawless beating all other phones hands down.- Once you figure out how to configure the setting the applications are very professional and reliable.- Battery life is vastly superior to other smart phones but not what one has grow accustom to in Nokia.Cons- Quality control has taken a nose dive. It is only beta at best.- Customer support is useless and on the att bad level- Need to sent the phone to Nokia for upgrades.- No t-mobile 3G support- The notifications are too common and awkward ie loud painful beep in your ear telling you the data is not active when dialing on a GSM based network.- Answering is a nightmare. There is a magic combo of lock keys sliding arrows and button presses. I never answer on time.- They throw the camera in your face it is very annoying to always press away from the video call option.- Lots of dead batteries with pictures of you answering the phone and inside of your pocket - There is a wide array of activities that stop the charging process.- poor touch screen response- None standard USB cable-n900 is much better.",2,2

The BLU phones have been on my short list but never made the cut, my mistake. When BLU introduced the Vivo-5 at a time when I needed to do a second ""factory reset"" on my phone at the time, I said no more short list, top of list. This device comes with more than enough ram @ 3gb and plenty of rom @ 32gb. Couple that with its eight core processor all that was needed was sd-card storage. A 64gb card I added has more than for my tunes, photos, videos etc. One note on the sd card, I needed to format it to fat 32 as the phone did not ""see"" my card in ntfs format. Another plus was no bloatware to complain about. All of the pre-installed apps are not a problem. One app on the phone that came in very handy was BLU Help. I thought the lack of an app drawer might be a problem but after 3 months, I am glad there is none. If you must have an app drawer you could always install one. Comparing this phone to friends Samsung phones and IPhones all I can say is you can save yourself about $500 by giving the BLU Vivo5 a try, it has a solid feel with the all aluminum case and looks great in gold.",5,5

This will be a great travel phone for anyone wanting to travel abroad because it is quadband so it will probably work anywhere in the world, and should be compatible with any GSM sim card. If you want your family to be able to reach you for emergencies while travelling abroad, you could just buy a GSM sim from T-mobile and put it on roaming. You can then buy a local GSM sim in the country where you are travelling and put it on the phone so you have a phone to use for your local communication needs. For a basic phone, it also comes with some cool tools like a calculator, a flashlight (can be turned on with just one press of a button), and an FM radio.

The screen is pretty sturdy too since it's smaller and stronger.I find the audio quality to be great as well. This phone has about the same dimensions as the iphone so not too big or too small for smooth internet browsing and to hold in your hand. One thing I wanted is a more fine resolution volume setting, the jumps between settings either make music too loud or not loud enough especially since I'm using the Cyanogen DSP audio booster.The front and back facing camera is awesome as well and can be used as a video camera too. Battery life is excellent if you either use the Cyanogen cpu governor and set it to conservative or use dl setcpu from market and do the same thing.I'm using this for t-mobile and consistently get the ""H"" or 4G speeds.

200466,Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,"I try not to write reviews about phones because one man's trash is usually another man's treasure... However this product deserves and honest review.The phone:6.1 inch display HD quality. This phone's display is on par with many other flagship phones of 2013, even some from this year like the Moto E. When you compare the screen size and pixel density I have to say Huawei did an outstanding job with this device. It comes with Android 4.2(Jelly Bean) it is an older version especially since Android L (Lollipop) is due out this month October. But this does not challenge the fluidity of the phone. However, Huawei's custom overlay takes away from the whole experience in my opinion, adding bloatware and needless menus. I'm coming from a few years of Nexus phones so I'm partial to using a pure Android UI. The processing speed is very good it is as fast as the Nexus 4, Galaxy 3, and others of that callabor, considering the price of this phone it is an absolute steal. Qualcomm processor with 2GB of RAM...are you getting the picture, its a great phone with descent specs!?The build quality is surprising good, don't sleep on Huawei, the company is making itself relevant in the US market by delivering great quality devices ( at least now they are, better late than never, right?)The camera has a 13 mega pixel rear camera with a decent 5 mp front facing camera. Remember the camera itself doesn't mean the picture quality will be superb, the software that runs the hardware is even more important, which is why companies like Apple and Blackberry can do more with less. That being said, the camera is good but not the best I've seen, much of that has to do with the software, just be warned its not a Sony class experience.The OSThis version comes shipped with Android 4.2.1 or 4.3.1 depending on when you purchase it. I do not know if Huawei will offer updates... It doesn't seem likely but who knows. Whichever version of Jelly bean you get with this phone, you won't be disappointed even with the custom overlay.The NetworkFor you folks in the US just know that this phone is unlocked, meaning you can go to any company that uses the same cellular technology and use this phone on their network. Any GSM carrier will do, T-Mobile, AT&T, Straight talk, etc. And yes you will get 4G with T-Mobile. Will you get LTE? I don't know, perhaps If you live in an area that offers it, but much depends on your carriers signal frequency. This phone does cover most in the US as far as my research can tell.The Storage16GB storage with a micro SD slot up to 64GB.2GB of RAMThe batteryIt last all day...and the next one...and maybe even the next one. 4050 mAh is huge and I mean huge. This phone is king in this regard.The verdictThis phone is a great value. For under $300, this phone will be well worth it. 4G LTE, Huge screen, Large battery, Jelly Bean, fair camera, unlocked, and a very nice processor. Quit debating and get the phone, If for some reason you get a defective device (it could happen but I doubt it) don't give up and it back and get another one. I'm sure you will find this company and phone to be a pleasant surprise.Cheers!",4,8

193598,HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Glacial Silver),HTC,"I thought I was making a good decision buying this phone.

I was going to get the S5, but I didn't see enough updates between S3 to S5 to justify the upgrade. All the phones prior this have been rugged (put through much abuse, with NO CASES) and never failed to operate.After a few weeks of owning this phone, I noticed the camera is definitely worse that the Galaxy S5 (a friend owns). After some digging online i found I had to scrub the damn camera lens with toothpaste to clear up some sticky muck from the factory!!!!The camera started to look a bit better after that, but not perfect.Then the kicker, my WiFi range was reduced to just 10 feet from a wireless router. After a month of testing, restoring factory defaults, I decided to call HTC and complain of a hardware issue. I sent the phone in for repair and they said up to 10 days. I am now 3 weeks into repair and still no phone. I might update this review in the future with a (hopefully) positive outcome.Maybe I just got a lemon?

85011,Blackberry 8830 World Edition Mobile Phone - Silver,BlackBerry,"I think this is one of the best cell phones ever made for someone who only needs to do texting and/or calling from anyplace in the world. The BB 8830 World Edition can access the Internet and you can check your e-mail with it, too--etc. However, I would rather do those activities using my home computer. Alternatively, my recommendation for someone who wants a touch-screen device (3G or 4G or later) with lots of ""bells & whistles,"" should probably get an iPad 2 (or later edition) or some other contending product.Note: If you are considering purchasing this cell phone (BB 8830 World Edition), make sure you understand whether the phone is being sold as a ""locked"" or ""unlocked"" device. If you need further “enlightenment” regarding “locked” or “unlocked” devices, then, do an Internet search for that information.Also, determine if the phone is: (1) ""New"" (never used); that it comes with or without a SIM card; (2) it has a new/unused battery; (3) it has a battery charger or battery charger USB-to-electrical outlet cable; (4) a complete user-guide manual versus an abbreviated version (that tells you little or nothing); (5) that it has a USB-2 data cable to connect the device to a computer--for downloading a BB OS v4.5.0.311 or later version software for the phone (e.g., probably the easiest way to upgrade the BB 8830 OS it to go your service provider’s web site and find the specific BB 8830 World Edition OS).Additionally, the BB 8830’s battery can be recharged (while in the cell phone) via the USB-2 cable if the Blackberry® Desktop Software is installed (on one’s computer).The USB-2 data cable can be used to copy an existing address book from a BB 8830 World Edition to your computer for backup, etc. via Access Manger’s Software). And, this is recommended just in case the BB’s OS crashes and needs reinstallation. That is, reinstallation will wipe-out all existing information or corrupted files. So, if you have a copy of your BB 8830’s address book--“all is not lost.” In addition, it is probably a best practice to write down all of your personal settings for you cell phone--just in case you need to reconfigure all of them anew.Moreover, if the BB doesn't have one or more of the following: A SIM card, desired memory, and, battery, etc. then, those accessories will have to be purchased separately (from a wireless service provider or an Internet-seller of cell phone accessories, etc.).Likewise, if you buy a ""locked"" version of this phone which works with a particular wireless service provider (e.g., Verizon Wireless, T-Mobil, etc.), then, you will have to take it to them for configuration-access and to get a service plan through their network. On the other hand, if you want to ""unlock"" the cell phone so that you can freely choose a service provider and/or to purchase prepaid card/access--then, you can go to a wireless service provider (of your choice) who can or will ""unlock"" it...if you purchase some type of data service plan (and, if necessary, a SIM card).Note: Make sure that when considering a SIM card purchase that it is compatible with your intended cell phone usage. In some cases, it might be wise to have several SIM cards which relate to local and/or international travel.If you can go on the Internet and find/buy a specific BB 8830 World Edition ""unlock"" key-code (for a “locked” BB 8830 WE)--ensure that you have or will have a SIM card and some type of data-access-plan. Furthermore, it is advisable that anyone using the aforementioned cell phone should get or download the BB 8830 World Edition User Guide (a complete booklet print-version is an included OEM accessory) and Access Manager.Note: VZ Access Manager (for Verizon Wireless users) and the BB 8830 World Edition User Guide both come on an OEM CD--but if you’re buying this cell phone online, the OEM CD may not be included. However, VZ Access Manger (which might be the same as the Blackberry® Desktop Manager), User Guide (partial or full version), and are available for download from various sources on the Internet. The full version of the Blackberry 8830 World Edition User Guide is probably your “best bet,” because it illustrates all of the phone’s features & abilities. Also, if you download the User Guide, while reading it, you can set the viewing size for your convenience.--Russell",5,4
390265,"Sony Xperia P LT22i-BK Unlocked Phone with 8 MP Camera, Android 2.3 OS, Dual-Core Processor, and 4-Inch Touchscreen--U.S.Warranty (Black)",Sony,"I think that it is important to state I have never owned a smartphone prior to this purchase. I never thought it practical to own one on the premise that I'd be stuck in a contract with some lousy company and spend $130 per month (college student/part-time work). Unlocked = no contract? Hell yeah. Tech awareness level: I OWN an ASUS g75V, 12 Gb RAM, nVidia GTX 670M, it's pretty cool but that's a different story, I emphasize own because I don't want you to think that I chisel designs in rocks for fun.Anyway, enough pre-review ramble there is plenty review ramble to kill a few minutes of your time. Sorry, non-refundable. Take it for what it's worth: If you want to skip the specifics of my review, go to the end and I will briefly restate the points made throughout in the last paragraph. Thanks :)The OS needs an update upon delivery. This is, apparently, important to do with ALL Android phones upon update: you must do a factory reset after you update your phone to 4.0 (ice cream sandwich), or else you will have APN issues, and certainly other software incompatibilities. This will mess with your multimedia message delivery and probably some other important things I can't fathom. Make sure you factory reset the phone before you do anything after the update, because you will inevitably reset it at one point and lose this info. Don't back up anything until you reset, unless you have rooted chances are you didn't remove the default APN t-mobile settings. (Trust me it is in this order.) In order to set the APN to your carrier, I think installing the micro SIM card, update the phone software through WiFi or internet, and a factory reset in that order would be the solution. (I run AT&T and spent quite a bit of time trying to swap out of the t-mobile default before resetting.)Still no jellybean, which is version 4.1. Apparently it's an awesome OS, but the Xperia P will not have the ability to update to this version for a few months. Other 2012 models already have the capability of updating to jellybean, which was disappointing to hear about, but quite frankly it was not that expensive and the specs on this phone kick ass anyway. Hopefully February-March? Doesn't bother me, but I'm sure others would like to have the newest software now. For that matter, jellybean 4.2 is coming with wireless hdmi stream! (For Nexus tablet)The processor is fast. It has 1 gig of RAM and it seems to be using about 300mb default to run the phone itself. I'm sure there are background processes going on that I can remove (live wallpapers?? dafuk!), but I was a bit disappointed to run Pandora, and notice that my phone was sitting at 40% of it's memory. This does not impede it's performance. I haven't rooted the phone yet, so I'm sure possibilities exist that I currently do not understand. Streams media 1 process at a time, but it's fast and high quality. This means that if you are listening to music and you open a new media file, it will pause/mute the other (DUH), or if you turn on the camera while listening to music it will also pause/mute until you exit out of the camera.If you go to GSMArena and compare a few phones you'll find that it has the same CPU as the iPhone 4S, but the Xperia P has 2x more RAM. So you can laugh at your outdated friends and family who tote the 4s or less. Anyway, look for yourself if you are interested: google GSM arena and search phone models.The 8MP camera is great. It has superb resolution at close-mid range zoom. If you zoom in all the way, there will be heavy pixelation and a delayed focus, especially if you are aiming at something far away. This sounds like common sense, but I think it should be said anyway. There are also edit options for photos that can enhance resolution. Man you can see like pores on people's faces and stuff. Gross! I have no complaints about the front camera.The speaker: Crystal clear speaker phone. Decent volume level: I compared to a Samsung Galaxy S3 and was put in the dirt. The volume on stock for SG3 was 2x higher than the Xperia P. I read that it can be amped up higher, but I wouldn't chance blowing out the speaker. That would not be fun!The headphone jack antennae is very sensitive so be sure to stand in open spaces, or be away from interference if you want to have best quality reception. I listened to radio for about an hour while messing with the phone, it is clear as day if you are in the right position. The only benefit I think to this function is that you can listen to the radio if you're on the go with those specific headphones in, but realistically it doesn't seem very practical considering you can access internet radio or play libraries of music from the phone itself. To each their own. The ear buds are excellent quality, however. I can hardly hear with them in and no sound on! Sony quality if you don't want to buy a set of Bose or Beats.This phone comes preloaded with tons of useful apps. It also has a few that I guess you wouldn't need that most likely run in the background. I read that you don't need antivirus on an android/smartphone? Whatever I'll leave that one for now, but I guess some other apps such as weather and multimedia player can be removed for faster processing speeds/less memory use. This being my first smartphone, you bet I went crazy in that app store! However, I have not removed any apps that were preloaded. You should always check your running tasks to ensure apps you thought you closed aren't still running in the background. That would kill the battery and slow the phone down.I really like the design of this phone. Buy a screen protector and at least a rubber case. It is made of plastic! I think .. But anyway if you drop it or scratch it it will most likely lose color and just become an ugly mess, so be careful. For some reason, Otterbox has no love for Xperia P. #fragileBattery life ... Hah! Well I can't say I'm surfing the internet, streaming videos, and whatever my manager is doing on his phone when he says hes taking a break every 10 minutes, etc. Don't expect much, the screen itself is 40-50% of the power consumption of this phone. It is probably using all that RAM I can't seem to find! Lol. You get a cool power consumption tool that tells you how wasteful that 4"" screen is! It was at 75% before I checked off a lower setting for brightness. I think I lose about 1% every 3.5-5 minutes browsing the internet/texting/streaming music. So it has roughly a 5.8--8.3 hour battery life if you aren't going crazy with the data use, I imagine. I think some people reported less than 4 hours? Cool story bro.I bought a RAVPower® 10400mAh Dynamo-On-the-Go RP-PB07 External Battery Pack after reading a bunch of low reviews on the Xperia P because I'm not a helpless child who can't solve insignificant matters. So there you go: want a badass power supply? Buy that too! Charges all kinds of things, inexpensive, portable- you're welcome. Want a product review? It's awesome.The fact that there is no external drive option for memory sort of bothered me. I mean, I guess I've never had to anticipate all the junk I could put on a phone before, just mp3 players and whatnot, but still what if I wanted more options?? Well, my friends, OTG cable saves the day. I won't get into 2.0 USB vs 3.0 USB (10x faster!) because I can't actually say I've uploaded data using the OTG cable with a flash drive into the phone, YET!. ***UPDATE*** This does work. I bought a 3.0 USB and was able to upload movies/music, temporarily for viewing. I do not think you can file manage with a USB attached, you probably need to sync to a computer to upload, although I could be wrong. Do note: using a flash drive in your phone DRAINS the battery. I don't recommend it unless you have a power supply nearby.*** However, if all goes well grab one of these mini-usb male->usb female adapters and bam you supposedly have all kinds of external storage space. Just go buy the flash drive? If it works I'll change this paragraph at a later time. I can say that I plugged my Razer DeathAdder mouse into the OTG cable into the Xperia P and guess what?!? I had a cursor! So cool!It has a mini-HDMI slot, which is pretty cool. I could be cynical about it because I can't imagine how often you are in a setting where you have both your phone and an HDMI cable that you bought separately just for such occasions and you found an HD monitor/TV that just needed the crap stored in your phone to make things complete ... Oops. It's cool, really!Well I'm burnt out on this review. I should mention that GPS works perfectly. It's almost creepy to set it to my location and have a blue arrow floating in my room. Just make sure your data is enabled, of course! I generally leave data off unless I need it to check scores or I get lost somewhere and need to turn on Pandora while I check my facebook and there is no WiFi around, which I mean come on ... how often is that really? GPS data consumption is insignificant, just in case you were wondering.Conclusion: This phone is B A! If you buy it, remember to put your micro sim in, update OS to 4.0, and factory reset immediately. It's fast, faster than the iPhone 4s. If you need something faster, buy a laptop. The camera is great, there are minor flaws in zoom, but overall it is excellent quality with many options, front camera is good as well. The speaker isn't anything crazy, but it's clear and the volume is perfect for speaker phone or listening to music in a relatively quiet setting. The radio antennae is in the headphones, and they are surprisingly good quality. Preloaded with useful apps. Learn to root linux if you want to maximize the performance, but be careful. Fragile design, buy the appropriate accessories. Battery life varies from 4-8 hours. I have not experienced anything less than 6 hours, and I bought a power pack anyway 'cause that's how I do. No external memory drive. Buy OTG cable, connect a flash drive-there you go.I hope this review was helpful. I spent hours reading about various smartphones before I bought this one, and I am happy with my choice. It was extremely cheap, comparatively, and I did not even need a contract! Don't let those complainers fool you with their 2-3 star reviews, This phone deserves nothing less than a 4 (as I am sure others have owned more complex phones, or can afford more options in a single phone), but in my opinion it is a solid smartphone and I would rate 4.5 if it were possible, but it is not so I have rounded up. Thus the 5.0 review.Good luck!",5,37
281991,OtterBox Defender Series Case for Apple iPhone 6 Plus - Ink Blot,,I think my Otterbox is a knockoff and regret buying this brand name through Amazon. The issue with the case that I purchased is that the screen protector wont allow me to type or navigate though any app/site that I am on. So I purchased a new one through the Otterbox website and have no problems with the screen what-so-ever. I wouldn't even give this a star but that's the least amount that I can rate this POS.,1,1

265605,Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black),Nokia,"I suspect that guys giving 5 stars are getting paid money which should have gone into development and testing instead.I have had E65, E71 before this and like others here have been waiting for this half a year.I was not expecting much .. just a bit faster version of E71.Sp far I am amazed that they allow this to to pass quality testingHere are main issues:1) Psiloc World Traveler - if you are new owner don't touch it !! Once you configure it there is no getting rid of it. Since it is preinstalled you can't even uninstall it. So it keeps bugging me to connect to internet even when I am roaming.2) Truphone does not work with E72. This was my favorite VOIP application which I was able to use worldwide from any hotspot and call to my contacts directly. Entire VOIP integration is screwed up and you have to download it separately.3) No Podcasts. I was so used to download my favorite radio programms and listen to them on plane. So now I struggle with Escarpod.4) Browser is marginally better at rendering pages but crashes every session.Good stuff:1) Hotmail, Yahoo and Gmail connections seem to be more stable. On E71 they were getting stuck at times2) Camera is better3) Google Maps work4) Fring works5) Call quality is good",2,10

Absolutely the best feature of this style/type device. This is NOT a media consumption device though, Youtube looks dumb. LOL. So I won't be using this thing for media like I could my Note 4 or my Shield Tablet.I love the way it handles E-Mails, for instance my University uses outlook and I tried setting this up on my Note 4 and it wanted device administrator privileges and I am like N O !All I had to do on the Blackberry was type in my user name and password and wallah it worked perfectly very nice.I do feel more professional and just ""grown"" using this device though albeit I would enjoy greater internal specs just because it cost $449.99 ! I love BBM and the system so far works great, no camera lag like I saw in that one video and I have a lot of events.Speed isn't slow but it isn't ""fast"" but it feels amazing if that makes senseI was never into APPS and GAMES but I do use apps on my Note 4 like a personal finance manager, to do list, SMS back up restore, etc.. These apps I have used for YEARS. I really really REALLY love how EASY it is to go into individual app settings and manage app permissions !!!! OMG like YES..Android is got D__n intrusive ! Yes I am aware the government and the powers that be can access my devices GPS monitor my calls see my texts etc. ....DUH....BUT to at least have control over these apps is niceNow....I will do my due diligence to see if I can obtain similar apps to satisfy my daily driver needs. I bought a SIM adapter as I originally planned to keep both devices my Note 4 and this Classic. But really who wants to change devices everyday? It SOUNDS good and I LOVE my Note 4 just hate typing on the touchscreen !...but it sure is a BEAUTY inside and out.So.....idk honestly if I am going to keep the Blackberry Classic....the only apps I have are Facebook and Twitter and when I tell you there is only like 2-3 permissions total for each one I was amazed ! I love this. I won't be using the android thing only because to me I have a Blackberry device I need to use their APPS made for their system to achieve the BEST performance. SO time will tell but thus far a pretty decent device I love the professionalism and thought Blackberry puts into their devices and it very simplistic yet ""mature"" in a feel good way.Decisions I must make: Will I keep this device or am I currently experiencing nostalgia, will I use this and my Note 4 throughout the day via the SIM adapter tool, sell my Note 4 and use this solely as my primary device & use my Shield Tablet for my Android needs, return this and keep my Note 4, keep the Classic and have to sell it on Craigslist because my return time frame has exhausted LMAO.^_^ H E L P",4,19
271817,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked 4G LTE Windows Smartphone w/ PureView Technology 8MP Camera - Black,,"I started using this phone a couple of months after I bought it. Took it to India while travelling. Touch screen would freeze frequently. Took it to the Nokia dealer there who said it was a problem with the touch screen but warranty was not valid in India.Got it to the US and contacted Nokia , they asked me to contact Amazon/FGS as according to them the device sold to me did not have warranty. Emails from FGS were inconsistent , one email said there was no warranty another said there was . However they did not provide any warranty information. Amazon's response was that it was beyond 30 days of purchase. I tried to convey to Amazon that I was not asking for a return , I only wanted warranty information. Bought this phone for $550 and neither Amazon nor Nokia took responsibility. I exploring other options that might be available for customers like me.Lesson: very important to check warranty information immediately after receiving a product.",1,9
194228,HTC One M8 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) international version (Red) [No warranty],HTC,"I start every review with FIVE STARS and remove one per flaw, defect, issue with shipping, seller issues, or functionality. The phone arrived quickly and was packaged as described. It is also an official HTC branded device, not a clone as some may suspect. Still FIVE STARS because of fast shipping.The color on the HD display and the actual color of the phone is gorgeous. It is an attractive piece of technology. Still FIVE STARS.The sound when watching movies and listening to music through the front facing speakers is OUTSTANDING thanks to BoomSound. It's like they take the best sounding parts of the music and enhance them. Clear and crisp, with sparkling high end (treble) and full, round and warm low end (bass). Still FIVE STARS.The front facing selfie camera takes super clear and sharp pictures of you and whoever is in the shot with you. If you're big into selfies, this phone is for you. However, the 4 UltraPixel camera on the back will surely disappoint you if you are big into taking pictures of things besides yourself... Like other people, a cityscape, nature, or a house interior. Lighting is hard to catch properly. I'm more into the vanity aspect of this phone (selfies and phone looks) but I'd be upset if I wanted to show a house or take pictures at a wedding and saw the not so clear pics that this phone took. It has a great focus but it blurs out everything else. It's like it only wants you to focus on one thing in a photo. I'm okay with this because again I'm into selfies. Caution to the buyer who wants to take photos of the world around you, but still FIVE STARS.I had questions for the seller regarding condition of my HTC One m8 and carrier compatibility and called the phone number listed on the Amazon page for Mega Mobile (the store/merchant). All calls were directed to the voicemail box of a mobile user and no messages or texts were ever returned. MINUS ONE STAR.I will say that if you are purchasing this device for usage in the USA on a carrier like T-Mobile or AT&T (this device is GSM unlocked only... Do not purchase it for Verizon or Sprint as it WILL NOT WORK), do NOT expect it to work on LTE here in the USA. It won't. Our LTE bands in the USA are different than the ones for overseas, which is where this device originated (Taiwan) and was intended for use. You can only expect this phone to work on 3G or on HSPA+ (I use T-Mobile). Still at four stars, because this is in the seller description.NOTE: Most overseas carriers from Asia to the Middle East do not require contracts and do not do device subsidy plans on accounts so consumers purchase the devices at full price and use them unlocked on LTE bands overseas.Build quality is nice but on my particular device, part of the frame seems warped and not due to my usage as I use a case so perhaps this is a defective unit. MINUS ONE STAR.Even after the update to Android Lollipop 5.0.1 (which was almost instant after the first power up because this is factory unlocked and not carrier branded)... Battery life is stunningly poor. I turned off background data for all of the data consuming apps, turned off the vibration feedback on keypress, lowered my screen brightness and only used WiFi when needed in data restricted areas, since I'm on T-Mobile's Truly Unlimited Data plan ($30 on top of the base price). Still, battery life suffered. MINUS ONE STAR.OVERALL... It is a great looking phone and I love the color. It is easy to use and customize, but the fact that the build and battery life seem defective hamper the overall experience. In addition, the seller needs to be better about communication with his buyers.",2,1
126407,"BLU Life One Unlocked Dual Sim Phone L120, 16 GB, White",BLU,"I spent hours researching phones and finally decided to get the BLU Life One L120. I have been using it for about a month and overall I am very pleased with the phone. I won't bore you with repeating all the good things about the phone but rather focus on the little issues that I find could be better.1. Weak WiFi - My office desk is about 20 feet from the WiFi router, separated by a couple of drywalls. At most times I get 2-3 bars on the phone and using apps like 'WiFi Analyzer' I see that the signal strengths I get are around -65dBm. I noticed the low bars at home as well and compared the results with an iPhone (no apps to give specific signal strength) and a Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Using the same app with the phones sitting right next to each other the difference is about 15-20 dBm in favor of the Samsung. This area could use some work on BLU's part. At times I will lose total WiFi connectivity if I step away too far (even at home).2. Touchy buttons - The backlit menu, home and back keys sometimes don't behave. At times when I touch them, they won't do a thing and at other times it will register a single touch as multiple touches.3. Processor - At times I like to play a very processor and memory intensive racing game called ""Real Racing 3"". Even though this app is installed on the internal storage the load times are horrendous and lag is clearly visible. This game normally has great graphics but this phone will not render them properly (does a B+ job).Other than the main issues listed above I have nothing but praise for this device. Camera, Dual Sim, Screen size all are great features to have especially at the phenomenal price. And since these issues don't affect my daily use of the phone as much, I am giving it 4 stars.",4,7
369494,Samsung Galaxy S7 Dual Sim Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - Internationally Sourced (Middle East/Afican/Asia) Version G930FD Dual Sim- Black Oynx,Samsung,"I spent forever looking everywhere for the Advanced Calling section on this phone to set up Verizon wi-fi calling, one of the main reasons I bought the phone. My Verizon 4G, and at times even 3G service, comes and goes in my house. After starting to think I was crazy, I googled the problem and then called Verizon, and indeed, Verizon does not support Wi-Fi calling on this phone because it is unlocked. It would have been nice for the specs to say that. And also, speaking of the specs, even though I am on Verizon, I note that while this phone is advertised for all US carriers, it is missing band 17 for AT&T users.Lastly, the phone is very hot while just sitting there untouched, and in the two hours I spent setting it up, I watched the battery drop from 100% (I had fully charged it when it arrived) to 52%. It's going back. A real bummer since this phone was supposed to be the best there is.",2,1

182474,Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,"I specifically bought this version of the galaxy (rather than the newer s6) because it claimed to be waterproof. It wasn't. Accidentally dropped it into some water (with all of the ports sealed and the back case on), and now it is dead. I tried to dry it out, but it is still dead. Of course the warranty doesn't cover water damage... even though they market the phone as being protected against just this scenario. I was a loyal Samsung customer, but this is absolutely the last Samsung I will ever buy. I have also become THAT person who rails against Samsung at every opportunity. I will probably get some tee shirts made at the local airbrushing place at the mall with ""Samsung Lies"" printed across them, with a sad, dead, phone, slowly leaking water in the background. I will insist that all members of my family wear these shirts whenever they are in public. The kids will probably be happy with this arrangement, since they wanted iPhones anyway. Maybe I'll hang a bedsheet with ""Don't believe Samsung!"" hastily scrawled on it with dripping shoe polish from my balcony. I'll lose all of my remaining friends (I have no idea how many friends I have left since my calls and texts have gone unanswered for days now), and have to resort to writing craigslist ads for new friends and a new phone, and then I'll probably get murdered. All because I bought this stupid phone. Thanks, Samsung. Thanks for ruining my life.BTW, when it worked (for a month, before it's ""waterproofing"" didn't do it's job) the phone was fine. Like the S4, but faster. And with fingerprints. And a heart rate monitor. The screen was pretty, with a warmer tone than the S4. I wasn't a fan of the 'recents' button instead of a menu button, but I probably would have gotten used to it if I had the chance. I'm not afraid to try new buttons. The sound would get a bit buzzy if you listened to headphones with the big charger plugged in, but that was okay too.",1,3

I use it where power supply is unreliable.3-The Chrome browser does not permit me to save web pages on my phone, a feature I enjoyed with the Android browser on my Motorola Xoom tablet running honeycomb OS. More so, I can't sync my bookmarks.4-Junk Sony software5-The earpiece provided is generic and doesn't fit my ears at all. I will never use it for sure.

Again I should have read the fine print. I was not expecting to pay $80.00 just to get started. Also they automatically put you on the most expensive plan. I thought this was a phone for senior citizens. Why would any senior send 2,000 texts per month?. I called and requested they lower my plan. Also apps are on the phone AND ACTIVATED which was driving up the cost. I thought you could activate the apps you wanted. I explained when I first called that I only needed a phone to send pictures to email. I text about 20 texts, if that, a month. I don't talk a lot. My family and friends communicate through computer more than phones. This phone is also VERY SENSITIVE. Just touch it or lay it down and something is activated. Also, you ""swipe"" to answer a call.

The camera is okay for the price, but they need to develop this camera for a better result pictures, overall, it is a good picture. There are lots of apps to choose to download. One time I dropped this phone on the concrete ground at school and it bounced back I thought I broke it, luckily its running smoothly. I dropped because it slipped on my hand, the cover is little bit slippery, so I bought a cover and its perfectly fine. This phone have 2 batteries included and the battery it last for 2 days if you don't use for video and games. The battery charging takes few hour to charge. I love this phone big nice screen and pretty looks. The touch screen works well I don't have probelem with it. I'm an apple person but since my Iphone stopped working after 2 years, I choose to buy a lower price phone and prepaid sim card to save money. I chose this phone and I am very happy about this gadget. The phone is only a week since I opened the box. I'll see and watch for the quality of this phone, so far the QUALITY is very good.

255455,Motorola RAZR V3 Black (AT&T),Motorola,"I recently purchased this phone with a 2 year contract with cingular. So far I have no major complaint. The phone looks very good and it has a good array of functionalities. One thing to note: the $150 mail-in rebate needs to be sent with the second month's bill. So you cannot send it immediately. The only thing that bothers me is its volume: the maximum is 7, but it is not enough for my ears (and I think I have no hearing problems) when the environment is noisy, such as inside a bus. I cannot say much about cingular coverage. I used it in Boston (in the city) and in Philadelphia (mainly in upper darby and in the University area). While so far I haven't noticed any blind spots, the bars are not ""raised"" enough in all areas.",4,8

I got a T-Mobile phone which works with 3G bands 1, 4, 8; that is equal to 2100, 1700, and 900 and does not work with 1900 my operator 3G band, also does not work with 800 and 850 as stated in the Tech details. So I bought a 3G phone that does not work in 3G which is equal to a 450USD paper weight. Needless to say I am surprised that Amazon been a company of such high reputation allows sellers to publish such false and misleading advertisement. If that wasn't enough Worldwide Distributors return policy clearly states ""Cell phones may only be returned for refund within 3 days if they have been unopened and all original seals are intact."" You will need to open the box and turn the phone on in order to see frequency with which it works, so this means, screw you, we will not accept the return of the phone. Last but not least, should you happen to know which operator works with which frequency, they have this little pearl in the return policy ""Buyers are responsible for network, GSM band, and Carrier compatibility, including internet browsing, picture and text messaging functionality which are not guaranteed."" Double screw you, you just paid 450USD for a paper weight and you are stuck with it.

11614,Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,"I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that's a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone.",1,152

The FCC number on the phone that I received is for T-Mobile. You will only be able to use Edge(2G) from AT&T, and only receive 3G if you are a T-Mobile customer. False advertising. Luckily I will be leaving my AT&T contract soon.The other thing that needs to be pointed out, is that these models are the NEWER models which DO NOT use the superior AMOLED technology. It uses Super LCD (SLCD) instead, which is a dying technology. I was very disappointed to learn this, because my previous phone was an AMOLED, and it's difficult to go back to ordinary LCD. The display is still fantastic, but will not have the better power usage, low heat emissions, and the extremely high contrast ratio that AMOLED technology provides. The only benefit to SLCS over AMOLED is that it's easier to see out doors.Everything else about the phone is perfect. I personally think its form factor is much better than how Android phones look these days (black rectangle). Plus, the trackball is a nice addition.",3,4

Long story short, it is a very nice phone. The pros are huge and other than no LTE in the US, the cons are all just annoying. You can get H+ speeds but not LTE...Pros: price, performance, the way the back cover works, dual sim, usb/power plug and 3.5mm audio plug on top, beautiful screen pictureCons: no LTE in the US, Chinese font on some buttons (usually very obscure places and the other button is in english so you will know what it means), takes forever to charge, themes are chinese only, bloatware (DU Speed Booster, DU Battery Saver and Clean Master) really suck.I have rather large hands so the phone feels very comfortable while I am holding it. The crisp clear screen resolution is amazing to watch video on and reading an ebook is pleasant because the screen is so large. While I was un-boxing the phone, I noticed the back cover is more than a cover, it basically is an exoskeleton around the phone. It is made of a light weight plastic type material the completely surrounds the phone. I like how the chrome buttons contrast with the bright yellow exterior. Everything about this phone just feels right in my hands. Everything is easy to reach and seems to be in the exact right spot.Once i slapped my Cricket SIM and 32GB micro sd cards into the phone, it powered right up. Setup was very common, simple and easy. I setup my google account and installed pretty much all of the google android apps to replace the included software. I have every intention of rooting the phone and removing all the included apps but I ran into issues. My phone shipped with 5.1 build VIBEUI_V2.8_1535_5.128.1_ST_K50-T5 ... This version has a locked bootloader and none of the one click root methods(kingroot nor Framaroot) work. CWR Rom Manager doesn't support the K3. Once I figure it out, I'll update the review.I started loading apps from the Play Store, about 15 or so. The phone never even paused while it installed all of those apps, one right after the next. I am very please with the performance. I paired it with a bluetooth speaker system and that went flawlessly. The sound it sends over bluetooth is crisp and clean. The few phone calls I have taken and received were both good quality.I plan on checking back in a few weeks to update my review with any new and pertinent info I'd like to share. Till then, go ahead and buy it. This may be the best bang for your buck phone on the market.",4,1

This would give me the best of both worlds as well as access to texting, calling and phone line associated apps.The design is great. The gold is a great color and slim in size and light. As with anything, a case would make it bulkier and I am currently trying to find one that is slim.My current AT&T SIM card worked right out of the box. I am getting H+ type service and not LTE but I am ok with it. On occasion, the wifi slows and pauses at home for me. I have many many connected devices at home so could be an overload issue as well. On such occasions a simple on/off of the wifi option would fix things for a while. It might just have been an android issue.Overall, I am very pleased with it since I finally have a tablet sized device (7 in being the minimum for me since anything less is too cramped...so the Note, Galaxy etc phones are a no go). My 128 GB SD card works great right out of the box and sits securely in the top dual sim holder.I got it from Mega Mobile and everything was set up like a normal tablet. Google play store etc was pre installed on it as well. Basically nothing that would indicate a foreign product etc. There were a couple of apps on there that showed chinese but can be deleted as needed. Also there are some useful on board apps for utility type usage.Speakers are great for a small tablet. Mine came with a screen protector installed...a bonus since I am OCD when installing one with even a single dust particle on it.Overall a great tablet and rare-use phone for someone looking to consolidate. It is definitely more of a tablet obviously than a phone in size.Any questions feel free to ask in comments and I will try and answer.",5,15

I like the phone in itself so far. Going from a smartphone to a basic phone with features will take a little getting used to. But as a basic phone, this phone does have a lot of great smartphone features that is part of the package.I only am giving it four stars because when I opened the phone to install the battery, the battery package showed that I had been given a ""re-conditioned"" battery that was last tested in ""August, 2011"". I was surprised and angry but since Amazon did the fulfillment for the sale, I immediately wrote to them and asked for a new battery. An apology came back telling me I could either get a full refund or they would refund my account a certain percentage of the cost. I wrote back and asked why I could not just get a new battery. Amazon fulfillment apologized again for the mishap and made me the same offer explaining that the seller, Cell-source, has inventory that is changing constantly. So I guess Cell-source doesn't have any more ""new"" batteries! Based on their name, I would have assumed they should have all different kinds of accessories. I am accepting the partial refund from Amazon because I need the phone and don't want to go through all that work of trying to find another one. Please understand that I realize it is not Amazon's fault but the seller.Do not buy anything from ""Cell-Source"" since according to Amazon, their inventory is constantly changing. That means, they can't back up anything that you may buy from them.UPDATE: I have decided to return the phone. Too many small feature hangups. The phone kept locking my keypad and then asking me to unlock it. I could not find any information on how to shut it off. I couldn't get online with Samsung and AT&T was of no use. Wasted too much time on line trying to figure how to fix it. I spent 2 different hours on the phone over 2 days to try to get AT&T to help me.Basically as a general phone, I'm sure it is a good phone but it just wasn't for me.

If you so much as breathe too hard on these things, it will die a pitiful death right in front of your eyes, and it won't recover. But, assuming you keep it dry, you won't be disappointed!",4,2

However I HATE the fact that once i received the phone I found out that it wasn't an American phone! So now I have no phone because I somehow locked it and now I can't get it unlocked because I can't get a hold of the customer service in the country where my phone was made. American customer service tried to help me but had no luck. Also some of the Apps are in different languages that I cannot read and so I can't use them! Also when I got the phone it would let me receive picture messages but not send them and I had to get my mobile provider to send me a download so that I could send pictures. From now on I am just going to pay that much more to go into a store and buy one from them where I know for a fact that this stuff wont happen! Don't waste your time or MONEY!!!!,2,4

Anyway, that top manager at Amazon made it very easy for me. He got me an express mail that solved the whole problem, but I was on the phone for about an hour to reach that powerful manager.

239968,Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE Dual Sim Black 8GB (RM-1096) Unlocked international model- no warranty,LG,"I read the reviews on this phone, most say that it can receive LTE service on the T-Mobile network. It just wouldn't ""show"" it as LTE. The bands necessary seem to be there, but when I did a speed test against my LG G2, I had slightly less than 1/2 the download speed, 14.5 mbs, vs 35. Not really a deal breaker for me, as the 14.5 is plenty fast enough for what I usually use the phone for...but...I might not have bought it knowing that.Having said that, it isn't worth returning as it is really a nice phone. My biggest fear was that I would be doing a downgrade on the 640XL camera vs. my LG G2. The camera so far has been perfectly acceptable to me. Keep in mind I am not a professional photographer, just a guy that like to have his phone/video/camera with him at all times and wants to record good if not great video when the moment strikes. This phone more than meets the task.I made a 1080P, 30 frames per second video on a cloudy day of a bush being blown by the wind. I connected my camera to a 60"" plasma and the picture was very good with no artifacts. All in all a great phone, except for the speed.

After only three months of use the phone has started malfunction. It constantly switches itself into and out of multi-screen mode and neither of the two keys (Recent key or Back key) function for a few minutes afterwards. This is very frustrating and render the phone useless. This would happen even when the phone was not in use (just sitting on a desk or table). Another very frustrating problem is that the phone is set to the country of Korea and even when the language is set to Spanish or English some Samsung apps and menus still display in Korean. Some apps (like Samsung Pay) keep telling me to “install a SIM card for the country you are now in” which is the first thing I do when I enter a new country. I go to a local phone store and purchase a SIM card and phone plan. The phone has been mostly useless during my trip but I do have to say the few times it has function normally it has taken excellent pictures. This phone is sold with out warranty and I can see why; they are definitely not designed to last.In conjunction with this phone I also purchased the Samsung Gear S R750W Smart Watch which died three month after purchased. It is no wonder they are sold with out warranty. I am very displeased with the quality of both items and I have decided I will never purchase another Samsung product again.I contacted the seller of this product and was told that after a month I had to contact Samsung. I contacted Samsung and at this point I was in Spain. I was told to take the phone to the nearest Samsung technical support center which I did. The nearest center was in Malaga 67 kilometers away. I was told by the Samsung technical support center that since I purchased the product outside the European Union they could not help me. I simply had to purchase a new one.

Though I was happy with the Nexus phone, after nearly 3 years the battery appeared to be deteriorating. Google's new phone offering is much larger and I didn't want what amounts to a Phablet. The Samsung Galaxy S6 is only slightly longer and very thin and light. The camera is superior to my old Nexus. Apps are simple and easy to locate and adjust. So far, the battery life is quite good, but I'm usually using only basic text, phone and minimal data programs.My biggest concern was whether an ""international"" dual sim card phone would be compatible with my existing StraightTalk prepaid plan in Illinois. I ordered my new NANO SIM card and got the phone up an running without a problem. Originally, I struggled with getting the phone to receive data, which is included in my carrier plan. After an unsuccessful call to StraightTalk tech support, I realized the problem wasn't due to inaccurate APN settings, but because I had not selected the installed SIM card in the settings/SIM card manager option.The dual SIM card feature in this phone is pretty cool.

164421,"BLU Win JR 4-Inch Windows Phone 8.1, 5MP Camera, Unlocked Cell Phones-White",BLU,"I purchased this phone to replace my daughters Lumia 520. Windows Phone 8.1 runs extremely well. It is very responsive. The backup from the 520 downloaded and installed quickly (over wifi). Music was transferred with the micro sd. All album art and music quickly synced and was ready to play immediately after setup. The only thing that would remind someone that this is a budget phone would be the screen size 4"". The body is plastic but feels very sturdy and the back was easy to open unlike nokia phones.Now I use the Lumia 1520 (The Windows Flagship Phone) and it would be unfair to compare the hardware with this phone. But I can honestly say the OS felt just as responsive on the Win Jr as mine. Also if you have not used Windows Phone before this would be a good phone to give it a try. The OS is elegant and feels like it was built from the ground up to give the user the easiest and most enjoyable experience possible. I previously used an iphone 5s and I must say after using Win Phone 8.1 Id never consider returning to ios.

107275,"BLU Dash 4.0 D270a Unlocked Dual SIM Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.0 ICS, 3G HSPA, and High Res LCD Screen - U.S. Warranty (Black)",CT-Miami LLC,"I purchased this phone in hopes to replace the smart phone I purchased while in the Philippines (Cherry Mobile Flare). The Blu Dash 4.0 D270a doesn't quite stand up to the performance of the Cherry Mobile Flare, but since the Flare doesn't work in the United States, it is a pretty close replacement. Overall I'm pretty pleased with it so far. But like anything there are positives as well as negatives with anything. Some of the specs provided on Amazon and Blu's website ([...]) are a little off. Not anything major but I will run down those and the minor negative points of the phone in this review. [website & amazon specs]:4GB with 512MB RAM; Dual Core 1GHz Cortex-A5; 5MP camera (main)/ 0.3MP camera (front); 4 inch screen / 480x800 pixels; Android 4 operating system; Dual Sim Card GSM 850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900 Mhz/ UMTS 850/ 1900 Mhz; 3G HSDPA (AT&T only)/GPRS/EDGE/Wifi; Wifi hotspot capable; A-GPS support; SMS/MMS messaging; micro sd card support up to 32GBThe only thing I found to be a little off, was the main storage size of the phone. The phone reads in settings, and also in other apps I have downloaded, that the total size of the hard drive is 2GB not 4GB. That's a nice chunk of space for the phone, but I still put a 32GB micro sd card in it for more storage. The 512MB of RAM is not that impressive, but it handles most of everything I need my phone for. If you are the type of person that likes to download a lot of games, maybe it won't be enough for you. The Android version is 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich.I currently use AT&T's Go Phone service and the phone had no problem identifying the network. I wasn't sure if I would have to manually enter the APN settings, but the phone picks it all up automatically. I've had another unlocked phone with Unnecto, and I had to enter all that info in manually which took some time to research. I use the second SIM slot for my Philippine SMART sim card. It reads it just fine, and is set to roaming (which uses the AT&T network). The good thing is that this phone will also work when you travel abroad. I have not used T-Mobile with this phone, but according to what I've read, the 2G connection will work, but the 3G will only work with AT&T. The fact that the phone also has the ability to be a mobile hotspot is also a plus.One annoyance that I've found with the firmware of this phone is setting up certain contact info and ringtones. For some reason the phone would reset certain contact settings I had made to default. The problem has seemed to stop, but it was irritating at first. Trying to set custom ringtones for contacts is also an annoyance. Unlike the Cherry Mobile Flare I own, Blu Dash 4.0 doesn't give you a menu in the sound settings to choose from your custom MP3's. You have to open them in the audio player, and then set them as your main ringtone for sim 1 or sim 2. I have yet to find a way to set your custom ringtones for individual contacts. When you go to set the individual ringtone for the contact, the regular ring tone menu pops up, and is all that you can choose from.Another downside to this phone, is that I haven't been able to find much as far as accessories go. I contacted BLU through their website, and they referred me to an online dealer that had some BLU accessories, but nothing for the Dash 4.0. It would be nice to have a skin or case to protect the phone, but they just don't have one out that I know of. Universal screen protectors are easy to find, so you can trim them to custom fit the phone no problem. I've also tried a few different headset/mics in this phone, and only the one that came with it seems to work properly. The others will work as a headset, but the mics won't work for some reason. I have not tried to use this phone with a blutooth headset, but the phone is blutooth capable.Battery life is not the greatest. If you are using the phone pretty regularly to surf the web, or download apps it drains the battery faster. Certain apps can also eat the battery pretty quickly, so I've found that disabling them when not in use is the best way to avoid killing your battery. When using the phone moderately, the battery has lasted through out the day, but usually by night, you will need to plug it up.Overall, I would say that if your looking for a dual sim smart phone that won't break the bank, the BLU Dash 4.0 D270a is a pretty good choice. Blu also offers other smart phones with better specs, but they are quite a bit more expensive. $130.00 was more than what I paid for my Cherry Mobile Flare, but I don't think that you will find anything in the United States this cheap without having a contract phone. Unlocked phones are nice, and offer you the freedom of choice with your service.Hopefully this review is helpful to anyone considering purchasing an unlocked smart phone.Update 4/6/2013 :Check the comments to see how to resolve the ringtone issue.I have also encountered a slight problem with sending MMS messages. When I attempt to send them I get an error. Looking at the APN settings, everything is as it should be, so I'm not sure why it's not working. I've sent photos through different apps with no problem, but attaching them to a MMS, I always get this error. Maybe it's an issue with AT&T, but I will update if the problem is resolved.Update 4/7/2013 :MMS error resolved. I had to download a messaging app from the google play store, but it seems to have fixed the problem. I am finding out that the built in functions for this phone are not the best.

10,"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.,1,19
191116,"HTC myTouch 3G Unlocked Android Phone with 3G Support, GPS, and Touch Screen - US Warranty - White",HTC,"I purchased this phone for use on my Europe trip. Of all the phones I considered, this one was the overall best value for occasional travel use. The phone was unlocked as advertised but you must keep in mind that most mobile companies do require a data plan for smartphones. Also, to use the data capabilities you need to adjust the APN settings for the service provider. You can try to find these settings online or there are apps in the android market that will help with this.I recommend borrowing a friend's AT&T or other non-T-mobile SIM card to get past the initial startup screens. You can then use the phones wifi abilities to access the android market and load any apps you want (at least APN tweaker-free app) so you are not wasting vacation time doing this after you buy your prepaid SIM. Also, the phone will want to update to Android 2.2.1 which can be done via wifi as well.For the phone itself, the processor is slow especially after the update to 2.2.1 but this was expected being an older phone and a big reason why you can get this unlocked phone so cheap without a contract. You could refuse the update if you are concerned with this but you would not be able to use stared locations in you goggle maps account.Overall if this is for use on a one time or for occasional trips, buy this phone. If you travel internationally frequently, invest in a faster processor.",4,3
246530,Motorola Droid 4 XT894 4G LTE Black - Verizon Wireless,Motorola,"I purchased this phone for my wife and got poor reviews at first. Then, after using it a few days, her only complaint was that the battery ran down too quickly and cut short her fun! She loves the larger, tactile QWERTY keyboard and the larger viewing screen the Droid 4 offers. She also loves the ability to see and enjoy pictures received. We just ordered a battery from SavvyCellular and are hoping that this will fix her issue with the phone running down before the end of her 12.5hr shift on a full charge. Still, if you decide to find a Droid 4 to get the larger screen without sacrificing a tactile keyboard for a virtual one, it seems like a good phone to consider. Just know that you will be on Amazon and Ebay trying to find batteries and accesories, since most carriers no longer carry this phone.",4,1

I just purchased a micro sim from AT&T with a $10.00 a month call and text plan ( without any data ) and she was good to go. She does not use it for a MP3 player or to listen to the radio as she mainly uses her tablet for them things. I haven't even told her that it has the capability to do those things. She seems plenty happy with it just being a phone. A lot of reviewers have stated that the sound volume is to low for them. I would have to agree with them. I could not use this phone on a daily basis without constantly having to ask callers to repeat themselves. I'm a 49 year old man that doesn't hear well to begin with. Anyhow she has not complained about it so far so I have not really worried about it. The phone also is set up for to SIM cards (which she doesn't need) but the phone works fine with just one in it. If your looking to buy an inexpensive phone, I hope this review was helpful. Gave it four stars because of the volume issue.",4,1

It seems that it made matters worse because at the time,\the phone started to self hard boot on its own. extremely frustrating when you are on an extremely important call.I had hard reset the phone twice at the time because at the time the phone didnt want to function properly.I contacted Asus and informed them about it.I started to bump into people who own this phone and they have mentioned that they was going through problems with their phones as well.Moving on today July 12 2016.My phone is again unstable and have to hard reset the phone.It seems that even though the phone is 90% charged, when I disconnect my Anker battery pack from the phone, the phone goes into Black screen and does not want to function.Even though the phone is 90% charged it does not want to come back to life UNTIL I plug in my Anker battery pack again.I Re - hard booted the phone TWICE today on July 12 2016 and the phone does NOT want to act properly.Its completely unstable and only works when it wants to work......

With my low expectations, I was quite surprised.This phone works better than similarly priced brand named phones on the market. That is, any Android phone running less than 4.0 was SUPER slow. This phone however had a large screen and was not too slow.My only complaints are these:- The earphone jack is too loose and my headphones slip out of the phone like it's oiled.- I had phone numbers already, and I had A LOT OF TROUBLE getting around the text messaging error. I figured out if you directly type in their contact information as a stream of numbers, i.e. xxxxxxxxx rather than xxx-xxx-xxxx, (xxx) xxx-xxxx, etc, it works just fine. I'm still trying to figure out how to fix that problem.- charger slips out too easily- it gets really hot sometimesOtherwise, things I love:- it came with 2 batteries!!!- one of the two cases the phone came with has a cover. It makes it easy for me to protect the phone screen. That said, I wouldn't risk dropping it.- smooth- still a knock-off; when people ask what brand/model it is, I tell them with humor that it's a good knock-off phoneAgain, I've previously had 3 ""cheap"" Android 2.x phones around the $100-$120 range, and they don't even compare to this phone.UPDATE 10/12, I am lowering my rating.. 3.5 stars really:Okay, so I've had this phone for much longer so I've got some chance to complain about it more. The longer you have it, I feel the longer you really get that it's a knock-off.Here are some more TRICKS AND FIXES:- download another browser; there's something about the built-in one that just really works terribly with this phone- the sound quality is DOWNRIGHT AWFUL; I have to push the phone's speakers directly into my ear to really hear someone sometimes- microphone quality is EVER WORSE; this is NOT the phone to do business with, I've received many many many complaints from custom service reps, friends, and colleagues that they have a hard time hearing me -- once they start saying I sound faint or far away, I cup the phone's microphone hole at the bottom of the phone so the sound bounces from my hand back to the microphone- find another charger if you can; funnily enough, the Kindle charger I had is tight enough that the phone won't fall outSome good notes:- this phone can take a beating, I've dropped it a lot of times. There's now a faint crack near the bottom of the screen, but I will deal with it. Also, it's super cheap so I don't get buyer's remorse like I would with a $700 phone.",3,2

102705,"Blackberry Z30 Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black",BlackBerry,"I purchased the BlackBerry Z30 unlocked cell phone 15 days ago, after purchasing the Z10 unlocked in February, 2014. Unfortunately the Z10 was delivered with a defective camera, but AMAZON reimbursemed in full (very nice, :-)). After 10 months using the Z10 (it is a great cell phone, but the camera was not available), I decided to buy the Z30. I am not disappointed, on the contrary.I configured the phone to be locked after 30 min. To unlock it is really fast.The blackberry hub, already available in Z10, is a great feature, which avoids opening several apps and concentrates all ""comunnication apps"" (e-mail, whatsapp, phone calls, msm, bbm) in a sigle ""area"". This is truly very practical.The contacts are very easy to edit and, moreover, to ""clean"" useless information. By this I mean duplicated contacts, editing contacts information, etc. All very easy and intuitive.An issue I found is that JAVA does not run in either Z10 or Z30, which is a problem for JAVA-based apps.Some apps are beautifully designed for Z30, but there are not too many choices. It would be good if app developers dedicate some efforts to BlackBerry cell phones. Not all people use iPhone or other operational systems running cell phones.The BBZ30 sound is crystal clear. The camera works beautifully :-).But, the most impressive feature of Z30 is the internet connection: VERY FAST. When trying to use my cell phone, my friends using other cell phones were really very much impressed, as I am. Navigating with Z30 is an amazing experience because of the quick connection and fastness. A truly great feature of Z30.The Z30 design is very beautiful, although a bit big in size (but thin!).Overall I am extremely happy with BBZ30, but I must confess: I am a BB fan. Not everyone is supposed to use iPhone or Android, or other operational systems based cell phones. I have been using BB over many years, although it is considered by many people for ""conservative people"" or only for business man, what, to me, is a complete stupidity.Believe me: BlackBerry Z30 is a great cell phone.Update on September 20th, 2015: I am more happy than ever with my BlackBerry Z30 cellphone. The BlackBerry operational system has been updated a few times, with no trouble.But the most AMAZING FEATURE is the app BlackBerry Blend, which allows you to connect your cellphone in full with your computer and with your iPad. This app is great, not only because it works very well, but also because it is very practical. When in work, I don't have to stop using my computer or tablet if it is connected to BB Blend. I can see all messages, etc. Even better would be if the BB Blend developers would make the phone calls available through the computer or iPad (using an earphone), and also if the phone could access my computer and iPad. That would be absolutely great.BB Z30 is absolutely fantastic!",5,35

About 1.5 months of use, I put the phone on the charger at bedtime, next morning it would not power on. As this is an unlocked phone, I assumed it was the OS. After reviewing many forums and calling Asus, I decided to ""root"" the phone. This remedied the problem with the touchscreen and I actually got the Marshmallow OS on and was loving it. I was so happy my phone was working. After maybe a month, I noticed that the battery life wouldn't get me through a day before completely going dead. Today, after a full charge, it won't turn on. When I push the power button, it vibrates and flashes the ASUS startup splash, reboots with the same process until I take the battery out. I noticed that the battery drains down to about 85% during this symptom, so I am thinking that the battery is bad. I will see if a replacement helps.

246058,Motorola Droid 2 Global Winter White (Verizon) A956 Smartphone,Motorola,"I payed for a NEW A956, i received a REFURBISHED A955. When i recieved the phone I knew immediately it was a refurb because the Battery cover was a different shade of white than the rest of the phone, and the screen had some dust under neath it. After using it for a few days i found that it would not play video content, but honestly all i needed from it was GPS navigation, and it did(and still does) that just fine. So i was disappointed, but it did what i needed it for and i figured i'd just keep the phone. However, the last week or so it has developed a wonderful new problem. The touch screen does whatever it wants. I want to browse the web? Too bad, my phone wants to text ""ujnunujnunununjnunununjnun"" to my grandparents. I'm going to look into a refund, but i'm pretty sure its too late.Anyone who is considering this phone take note that the physical keyboard has no buttons, instead it has a smooth surface with little bumps for the letters. I personally do not like it and even after several months of using it, am slow and inaccurate when texting. Not a problem i ever had with my HTC Dream/G1.",1,1

289092,"PalmOne Treo 650 Unlocked Phone with MP3/Video Player, and SD/MMC--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)",PALM,"I owned a Treo 180, but after many years of service and a lot of duct tapings, solderings and super-gluings, the Treo 180 was due for retirement. I'd been planning on replacing it for a while, but since Palm seems to crank out a new smartphone every three seconds, I was having trouble deciding on which model to buy. I wanted to get a 700p but since there were no CDMA networks available in my country, I settled on a 650. The Treo series of PDA phones are no joke, they have always been top-of-the-line products. The 650 is no exception. It's an excellent PDA and an excellent phone with few flaws.Since I could write a book on why this product is so great, I'll just list its few flaws:- The headset port is on the bottom of the PDA...the worst place for it to be.- Instead of a dedicated power button, the 4th hard button is now the power button. WHY!?!?!- Palm has been promising WiFi drivers for this PDA since it's launch, none have been delivered so far. Don't tell me about the finnicky, overpriced Enfora WiFi sled...- The Media program's viewing abilities are very basic. Three levels of zoom, pics come out looking badly pixelated when resized, videos taken in low-res mode are shown in a TINY box. A different photo viewing app might be a better choice. TCPMP is a better app for video playback.- The button layout sucks for gaming. You'll end up accidentally hitting the Home and Menu keys often.- More built-in memory would be nice. It's not bad now, the NVRAM system gives you 22MB of user-accessible memory, and the Treo has 10MB of dedicated RAM where programs are loaded to and run. And this PDA is QUICK. I'm a very impatient person, and I've never been irritated by having to wait for something on this PDA yet.- The screen and keyboard backlights cannot be independently controlled without extra software (such as keyshades or KBlightsoff). The keyboard backlight is rarely needed, it would seem to be only common sense to include such an option. When switched off it saves a HUGE amount of power.- The camera's picture quality isn't great, but it's on par with most high-end cell phones. BTW, the Sephia effect is great for taking pictures in the dark.- The LED is pointed directly into the user's left retina like a frickin' laser beam. There is freeware available to turn it off if the irritation is too great.- Doesn't come with a spare stylus. Every device that uses a stylus should come with a spare stylus. No matter how careful you are, it could slip out of your fingers and into a storm drain.- In a few instances some functionality (mostly keyboard shortcuts) has been sacrificed for user-friendliness. An annoyance to power users like me.- The biggest annoyance...on the Treo 180, if you held one key on the keyboard and pressed another, the characters would come out in sequence. This allowed the user to type more quickly by rolling the thumb from one key to another. Try this on the 650 and only the first character comes out. This makes the keyboard a bit more user-friendly to newbies but it can hamper the typing speed of thumb keyboard veterans such as myself. Not a big issue, just an annoying limitation.Well there you have it, a full list of what's wrong with the Treo 650, an otherwise outstanding device. IMO, all those problems put together don't justify giving this product less than five stars. I have no reliability problems (I have the latest firmware) and like I said, it's QUICK. Dissing this device is like dissing a supercar because it's hard to get into and the boot is too small, and I would recommend the same solution - look at an entirely different product. So, if you want a simple, fashionable phone just for everyday communication, move along smartly. If you want a no-nonsense feature-packed lightning-fast PDA phone, make sure you consider a Treo.I highly recommend the following accessories: JAVOscreen Treo 650 screen protector, Sandisk Ultra 2 SD-USB card, 2.5mm-3.5mm Headphone Adapter. You might also want to look at a pen/stylus combo and bluetooth headset.",5,8

Unfortunately, Lollipop did not agree with my phone and within an hour I had a nonfunctioning brick. The Alcatel ONETOUCH is by far the best phone I've had and really saved my bacon because my other option was a $600+ phone that I really couldn't afford.

When I took this phone to get a new SIM card the tech guy raved on and on about how great the specs are and how it's such a great deal. I can't really speak for that because I have no idea what the specs are in comparison to others. He fiddled with it for a few minutes and in that time 3 people who were trying to get new phones left to order this one. It really is the best deal out there.

375126,"Samsung Galaxy Star Pro DUOS S7262 Unlocked Cellphone, White",,"I ordered 2 of these phones. They have very little memory, and even adding a memory card does very little good. They don't come with Facebook, or even a good reader, such as Kindle. There is precious little memory to download the programs you would need, and the phones sometimes become operable, where the touch screen barely responds, I have missed calls and accidentally hung up calls on a few occasions because the keyboard has a lock that you are required to tap twice to access it, and there is no way to deactivate this lock. For that reason it is also very frustrating, and nearly impossible to access hotlines where you are required to push buttons to get through a menu, such as calling yoru local bank, for example. This might be a good phone for someone who simply wants to talk and text, but if you access apps at all, this is not the phone for you. After about a week I returned it and ordered a different phone.",2,1

After 30 minutes of Google searching without being able to find an English Language version of the manual, I gave up and returned it. Of course, I had to go thru the return process, including printing the return label, tearing off all the labels on the shipping box, re-taping the box, etc.Amazon shouldn't let this type of product to be sold without obvious warnings about this issue.",1,5

227669,"LG KP500 Cookie Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and Digital Media Player--International Version (Black), No-Warranty",LG Electronics MobileComm USA,"I only buy unlocked cell phones and simply drop in my prepaid SIM card. The Speaker in my Motorola L7 was going bad and I had to use the speakerphone setting just to hear the phone normally. So I was looking for a slightly better, more sophisticated phone. A semi-smart phone. This Cookie fit the bill perfectly. Its only slightly larger than the Motorola L7 and actually fits in the L7's case. I was apprehensive about buying this phone because it received a few really bad reviews. I took a chance and I'm GLAD I did. The only complaint I have is, in order to answer the phone several separate finger strokes are required. The instructions could be better but are for the most part adequate. The phone is fairly easy to navigate and intuitive. The camera isn't to bad (I haven't used the video yet). My only big complaint is if you store your phone book info in the phone as well as the SIM Card the phone book info is listed twice on the phones display. I would like to have WI-FI but I knew this feature was missing. I don't have a data plan so I can't say how well it surf's the web or how easy or difficult it is to read your eMail. I paid $133.00 for this phone and one week later it went on sale AGAIN for $99.00. Im very pleased with this phone even though I paid $34.00 more than I could have if I had procrastinated. You can listen to your music using the built in speaker, however if you use the radio feature you'll need to use the supplied earbuds because the antenna is in the earbud wire. Its a nonstandard plug, BTW. I now need reading glasses and you can magnify your ""Phonebook"" which is convenient but sadly none of the other displays can be enlarged. I've taken pictures of my family and friends and assigned their photos to their phone numbers ( the instruction book is weak on describing this feature) so when they call their picture pops up on the display. I would definitely buy this phone again.",5,5
47795,Apple iPhone 5s 64GB Gold - AT&T,,"I notice most of the recent reviews are reviewing the sellers or condition of used phones rather than the product itself. So I thought I would touch upon a few things regarding this product.The iPhone 5s works great on latest 9.3.3 IOS and the one I purchased fully supports AT&T 4G LTE. The fingerprint recognition system is a handy feature and easy to set up. You can register up to 5 fingers. The iPhone 5s runs on a desktop class 64-bit A7 chip which is said to be twice as fast as iPhone 5.If you're looking at buying an iPhone 5s, price is definitely a main consideration. But do you buy new or used? That depends.Personally, after seeing new iPhone 5s priced at 400USD, I would and did explore other options. I was fortunate to purchase a like-new 64gb iPhone 5s for 265USD in absolutely pristine condition with equally pristine original box and all contents from the original owner through Amazon.Apple has discontinued the 5s but because many people prefer the 4"" screen of the iPhone 5s over the 4.7"" 6s or 5.5"" 6s Plus, Apple released the SE in March 2016. The 5se has the same 4"" screen as a 5s and a 64gb carries a 499USD price tag. The difference in specs may more than makes up for the difference in price if you are considering buying a brand new phone.iPhone SE: Apple A9 1.84GHz Dual-core 'Twister' CPU, PowerVR GT7600 six-core GPU, 2GB RAM, 1624 mAh battery. CAMERA: 12MP, f/2.2 aperture lens, 1/3"" sensor, 1.22 µm pixel size, Live photos; 4K video, 240fps @ 720p slo-moiPhone 5S: Apple A7 1.3GHz Dual-core 'Cyclone' CPU, PowerVR G6430 quad-core GPU, 1GB RAM, 1560 mAh battery. CAMERA: 8MP, f/2.2 aperture lens, 1/3"" sensor, 1.5 µm pixel size, 1080p video, 120fps @ 720p slo-moObviously the iPhone SE has newer features and faster CPU and GPU, but the iPhone 5s is no slouch. It's a great feature packed phone IF you can buy it at a competitive price. And that price should reflect the fact that the iPhone 5s was released in 2013, its big brothers in 2015 and the SE in 2016. So, at some point in the not too distant future, the 5s will become obsolete and it won't be able to upgrade to the latest IOS.I hope my review was helpful to you and to anyone else considering purchasing an iPhone 5s.",5,3

I'll keep it short:They've promised android version 6.0 (Marshmallow) but have yet to follow through with that promise.The phone will often freeze for 3-6 seconds randomly despite formatting the device and starting fresh again.The speakers for both the earpiece and speakerphone are on the weak side so it's difficult to understand people in louder environments.If you're okay with those three things, then the phone is incredibly light and a nice value for the money.

97889,Blackberry Q10 SQN100-1 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked GSM Dual-Core OS 10 Smartphone - Black,BlackBerry,"I never write reviews, but OMGosh this Blackberry Q10 smartphone is perfect. I researched for a month, went out and held the Blackberry Classic at a competitor phone service who had the Classic on display and researched again. I settled on the Blackberry Q10 (which is a recently previous phone and a little different) because it has a replaceable battery which I think on amazon is under $10 and you can still buy this phone new. It is fast, looks nice and I love having the attached qwerty keyboard. This model has a twin that has the virtual keyboard and not the actual keyboard, but I wanted a quality phone with the actual keyboard. I put this on the $45 (-$5 for auto pay) so for $40 I get ATT prepaid/no contract on auto-draft and an amazing smartphone. No one makes fun of me now. Smartphone, unlimited text, talk and internet. The first so many bites is 4G and this phone is true 4G. I am not a heavy user so that is enough 4G internet for me, but even after I use up the amount of 4G it is still unlimited internet and I can't tell a difference ever in speed. I got this for under $200. I kinda wanted the black version, but it was $50 more and I decided to get this one and save a few $$. Now a little more about the phone... There are 3 versions, Version 1, 2 and 3. One of the versions has Arabic also on keyboard. This one I believe is made for USA but all work globally. What I did was copy out the band information and compared carefully the 900, 700 whatever all of that is and found the one that would make it match up with ATT 4G so I would FOR SURE get the 4G fastness. As you can see I am not technical. Keeps the charge for days if you want, it is a heavy weight on that. You have to get used to swiping up and sideways to get the screen you want (Classic has buttons for this which I would have liked) but I have mastered this. You can have I think up to 4 searches/screens up at one time, while very tiny and I am not even close to 30+ and I just open back up the one I want to read. Both of my children have Iphones but I am the richest of us because I get the smartphone with all the same features for $40. Ok, not the name IPhone, but Blackberry is a quality phone too. Camera is good. Volume is a button and easy and sound is good. I wish I could do this phone justice by knowing more technically, but if you are considering it - take the leap. Just be sure to check out the specs and get the one that best fits you of the versions and type of keyboard. You'll be richer and get to laugh at others all they way to the bank!",5,3

If you are looking for an unlocked phone make sure you know what kind of service your phone company uses; CDMA or GSM. Samsung makes the Galaxy line in both types but a GSM phone won't work on a CDMA system and vice versa.This phone came with the ATT logo on the back, having been manufactured for ATT; and also came pre-loaded with ATT apps and phone numbers. It was easy enough to delete those that were not applicable. My initial concern was that the serial number on the box didn't match the serial number on the phone; however that doesn't appear to matter because the phone works flawlessly.The battery life on the Galaxy S III is so much better than on my wife's Galaxy S II.",5,5

Not to mention, the screen size is perfect for most apps I have.What's truly impressive to me is the battery life.

So I bought 2 of these phones for my parents, the phones look good and are fairly easy to use. Unfortunately they do not work, many times a day fail to receive either phones calls or text messages. The person calling is immediately directed to voicemail and the person using the phone is completely unaware that someone is trying to contact them. What makes it worse is the person using the phone can call or text fine, so they think the phone is functioning normally. The only way to correct the problem is to reboot the phone. When you reboot the phone you see you missed phone calls and text messages. This issue is happens multiple times per day. We have tried every thing we can to correct the problem including software updates and new sim cards. Both phones are having this issue so I feel pretty confident it is a phone issue. Additionally, ATT either will not or can not help you troubleshoot the problems, they treat you like a second class citizen because you dare to buy a phone from someone other than them.",1,3

The camera takes exceptional photos and video. The speakers are as good as can be expected from a phone...the notifications are quite loud.

The device has dual sim card slots, and both are mini size. I had to get a new one to fit.The 5"" screen is very crisp. I tried a 5.5"" device before this one, but it was just too big for constant use on the go.the only drawback to this phone, and probably most off brand dual SIM unlocked phones, is that it's nearly impossible to find a good case for the phone.overall this is a fantastic phone, especially for the price.",5,1

260153,NOKIA 301.2 FACTORY UNLOCKED QUADBAND 3G 850/1900 WORLD PHONE - BLACK,Nokia,"I love this phone! My previous phone was Nokia 5310 and I got this one as an upgrade recently because the buttons had cracked on my old phone. I like that this is a simple phone (not a ""smart"" phone, has no touch screen, menus are easy to navigate) but has all the features I need in a phone. The battery life is pretty good. I don't make many calls or send many texts and I get about 3 days of battery life before I need to recharge it. It was very easy for me to set this up with my contacts and plug into my (Windows) computer to install custom wallpapers and (MP3) ringtones. The camera is decent, seems to take better photos than my old phone did and the camera has more settings than the camera on the 5310 did. I have T-Mobile service and it was very easy to simply switch my SIM card to this phone from my old one. The USB cable (Nokia model CA-101) from my old phone worked perfectly with this one to connect it to my computer and drag/drop files and photos onto this phone. The Nokia 301 did not come with a USB cable. This phone has the ability to check emails and such but I never use that feature (I don't have the upgraded phone service) so I can't comment on how quickly it allows you to accomplish those tasks. My only real complaint about this phone is that it does not have full-screen photocall (like my old Nokia phone did) and it doesn't let me view photos as organized by folder from the mini SD card (just views them as if they were all in one huge folder unless you specifically save them to individual ""albums"" and then only view the album that contains the photo you want to view). Other than that, it's a great, simple mobile phone for those that are not really very tech-savvy. It seems to be made well and I'm confident that it will last longer than my old phone did. It is slightly larger than the Nokia 5310 and the buttons are bigger and more sturdy so they won't crack from texting a lot (like the 5310's buttons). I easily found a nice protective gel cover and clear screen protector film/cover for it on eBay.edit Oct 2015: I still love this phone. I've had it a while and still holding up great. None of the buttons got cracked at all even though I text often. I'm still getting about three days of battery life on it (the original battery) before it needs charging but I rarely makes any calls (only daily texting). The gel cover (bought from ""cbcelectronic"" on eBay held up great and easily protected the phone from the many times I've dropped it and the screen is still like brand new as well because of the protective film. I bought my Nokia 301 from the seller ""Zezoo Store"" on Amazon and it came brand new in original Nokia box.edit 2: I bought ""MaGeek® 6ft micro USB to USB Cable High Speed USB 2.0 A Male to Micro B"" for this phone and it is very nice quality cord that worked perfectly with this model of phone so I could transfer MP3s and photos and such between the phone and my Windows 7 computer.The phone is still holding up beautifully and I text often. I wish they still made this model phone, as I'd readily buy another if/when it ever breaks. I'm not a fan of ""smart"" phones or phones with touch screen. My phone still has the original battery though it doesn't keep the charge as long as it used to when I first got it and I charge it about every 2 days now.",5,1

FINALLY i have a smartphone that i can rely on, the battery last really long with regular use and all day (6-8 hours) with gaming/ music/video non stop use. the battery is also removable so it can be change later on when it dies permanently. the camera takes really good pics for a 5MP and there are lots of camera apps. picks up wifi easily. i updated to W8.1 so not sure if that's why but i can store/save games and apps to the SD card instead of the phone memory. hopefully i can now buy the 64gb card and get all the games i want (haven't done this yet). love the tiles and the phone it self is cute and simple.now truthfully some apps don't work/not available (phone in use in trinidad and tobago).

It was great for about a week, then it started to demand I insert a SIM card, when there was one in it that had been working.I checked online and this seems to be a known issue with the E71 that Nokia is not addressing.The phone is great when it works, the qwerty works well, easy to use and dial numbers on. 4 days of battery life, all the fans of this phone are correct.But if it does not work it is worthless.I tried cleaning the SIM card contacts with an eraser and alcohol, improving battery contacts, even resetting the phone to factory defaults. Nothing fixed the problem. Yet the same SIM chip fired up without a problem in the E75 every time I swapped it back.So I am returning the E71 to Amazon.

It has the Samsung name it should be supported anywhere Samsung has tech support. So I called Samsung USA, and they said I have to call Samsung UK.

21149,Apple iPhone 5 64GB (White) - Sprint,Apple,"I love this phone BUT...there are a few things you must consider when buying this. First of all, it is an iphone 5, not a 5c or 5s (which are more common) and therefore there are less accessories that fit it properly. I bought a case and while it looks great, it's slightly loose on the bottom (which may be a problem with the specific case I got and not the phone). I'm used to it now and it's fine. The MAJOR issue is that this phone does not come with a sim card in it. I ordered one here on Amazon and after the phone and the sim card arrived I took it in to have it set up and the sim card didn't even work. So, it was quite a bit of work on my part to track down a sim card that actually worked in the phone. I ended up going to Best Buy, where a great guy named Lincoln pulled out a stack of sim cards and made phone call after phone call to find one that worked for an iphone 5. After about 30 minutes, I had a working phone. It was a headache and a half to get that taken care of. However, once the sim card was in and I had a working phone, I was in love. The phone came in the mail quickly, without blemishes of any kind (looked brand spanking new) and had a TON of memory, which I love. It's a wonderful phone and the company shipped as quickly as they could from another country (I believe I got it in 7 or 8 days). So, if you aren't in an absolute hurry and you don't mind spending some time searching for a sim card (or you already have a sim card from an old iphone 5), then this phone is a fantastic buy! You may even consider calling your local carrier and seeing if they have the sim cards in stock for an iphone 5, not 5s, before you place your order.",5,1

The phone comes on and vibrates, but the screen remains stubbornly black. After a few hours of customer service and tech support calls, I had to order a replacement from the manufacturer and pay a wonderful fee. The icing on the cake is Otterbox is not responsible for damages to the device: they'll replace the $50 case for me, but not the $700 phone...which is completely unhelpful since the case didn't do its job in the first place.I've seen the videos on youtube of people dropping their phones with otterboxes over 50 feet and the phone surviving just fine, but that was not the case here.

This makes swipe worthless (as I sit here pecking out this review one letter at a time)Second-the case weighs more than the tablet, and the tablet isn't a light weight in the first place. This thing all put together weighs more than my first netbook from 8 years ago. I don't need it to travel around with, it just stays by my bed, but if you plan on taking yours with you a lot I'd consider something lighter.This thing is a tank.

324915,Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N900V 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Smartphone - Black,,"I love love love love my phone!!! It was an unlocked Verizon phone that I could use on Straight Talk for Verizon Networks. It came quickly, the price was great ($299 refurbished) and looked brand new with all of the OEM accessories. Because I was using Verzion, I had to get a special LTE sim card for the phone in order to get LTE service (which works great). If you have Straight Talk send it to you, its free or if you are impatient, you can buy it as a bundle to your monthly service for @ $5.00 extra from any local big box store. I personally like free, so I waited. The hardest part of the purchase was dealing with customer no services to get the porting transfer complete. After that it was easy. I’ve had the phone about a month now. I’m still getting use to the size of the phone. I haven’t had any problems with dropped calls but LTE is spotty when I’m driving thru rural areas (to be expected). Finding a case for the phone was difficult and after a lot of research ended up with a UAG which has been great so far. BTW: you probably need to buy two cords for the phone. The box comes with one cord & a charging plug for the home and car. The cord is not standard so my old cord would not work and it’s a pain remember to transfer the cord from home <-> car when I think my battery is getting low or when preparing for a long car trip.",5,4

Also wish it had wifi, but I probably wouldn't do much more than experiment. I just switched from overpriced Verizon account I've had for many years, to T-mobile monthly with unlimited data, so the wifi is no big deal. Besides the fact that I love cats, including Hello Kitty and pink is my favorite color, I think it's great to have an unlocked phone. This is first time a phone I paid for feels like it actually belongs to me and none of it's capabilities are blocked. Much better to buy a phone with a few less features, but all features work, than to pay a lot of $$$ for all the bells & whistles only to get it home and find all the features you bought it for were disabled.",5,1

403304,"Unlocked NUU Mobile X1 5.0"" HD 4G LTE 16GB Smartphone with NFC and 2-Year Ltd Warranty, Black",NUU Mobile,"I lived in China for ten years and still have a home there as I do trade there. The Chinese made phone I bought three years ago developed a problem only the service department of the product can repair and as I wasn't going back for a couple of months I needed a dual sim smartphone to use until I go back. Knowing Chinese products like I do I was skeptical of the product, and knowing Onda was the manufacturer after I received it my skepticism grew. But as it was for temporary use I shrugged it off. Truly I was surprised. Of course it's not an Apple but I'm not an Apple freak. After I got it out set it up I was happy with the feel of it in my hand. The touch action is really good and sensitive and action is very good. I was very pleased with the speed of downloads and surfing the net is really fast. I really like the expansion with the 32gb microsd and if you know how to do it it will take a 64gb card as I put in it. My other phone wasn't expandable and only had 16gb internal, 1gb for apps and the rest for other things. My other phone has a 4.7 screen so I really like the 5.0 screen and still small enough to fit in my pocket if nessisary. I have only had the phone for a week but I am very pleased. I will have my other phone repaired in China as service there is cheap, but I will use it as a spare because I like the Nuu much better and my other phone is not cheap. As a matter of fact it was $150 more. I would definitely recommend the Nuu 5.0 dual sim. For the price you won't be disappointed.Update : DO NOT, NOT BUY THIS PHONE.",1,8

370609,Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Platinum Gold,,"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco. The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market. A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug. While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters. Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy.Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it. I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year. I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface. Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable. It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result.The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power. It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day. That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat. The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome.Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully. Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment. One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity. no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise.I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions. From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality.For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured. I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal. The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product.If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour. The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge.If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour: Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset. It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine. This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake.",5,1

You can mount the phone as a Mass Storage Device and copy songs over, but the phone will not recognize.Otherwise, Symbian OS keeps things quick and smooth, mp3/radio playback is crystal clear, and the camera (with flash) takes better pictures than my digicam.I think I used this phone on average 1 hour a day for texting and it went a whole week without needing a charge.

There are TWO cameras -- one front for FaceTime or Skype and one on the back for taking photos.The mobile operating system -- Android Lollipop 5.0 -- has so far allowed me to make calls without any problems.It's UNLOCKED. Global System for Mobile (GSM) for mobile communication means that I will be able to change the SIM card when I go to Europe. (At least I hope so -- I haven't tried this yet.) It also means I can change from AT&T to a different carrier if I wish to in the future.

If I talked on it constantly, I assume it would need charging more often.Screen shows time and date, strength of mobile signal and wifi signal and battery charge percentage. On screen quick use icons: phone, music, calculator, camera, contact list, product code scanner. After you swipe icons: phone, messaging, menu, email, google, camera, gallery. Press Google and several icons for different apps appear. Press menu and 20 icons appear for different apps.Why do I like it and not love it -- it didn't come with a SIM. I tried to get a Tracfone SIM package at Walmart but they didn't have it. They could order it, though. I went to the at&t store where the sales associate put in the SIM and sold me a package that got progressively more expensive as we went along. First it was $25 -- okay, not too bad. Then another $30 for ""RTR"" (a month's worth of minutes?), then a 40-cent FEE, AND TAX $3.85. I got out of there for $59.25 for the SIM and one month of service! Add this to the cost of the phone and one hopes that this is a phone that will work well for years. (I realize I have to add more minutes and this will cost more.) One big benefit -- the sales rep installed the SIM, let me select from a list of potential phone numbers and then swiped through a series of installation menus. (Thank you Dyllan!)One caveat: I noticed that the sales rep had to scratch off the waxy surface on the SIM package. These ""shavings"" stick to the fingers and could easily get on the SIM card, which is quite small, and ""gum up"" the electronics when the card slips into its slot.This comes with earphones, a manual, charger plug and an in-depth online manual and online support. I couldn't find much online information about installing the SIM and depended on amazon's great Q&A feature and the advice of some very helpful and supportive people.",4,6

You have to manually update the phone, no “Over the Air” update, since the SKU is “CN” (check the box the phone was shipped in) but the installed software was “WW” (check “about” phone in settings). So unless you are technically adept you most likely won’t be able to update this particular configuration. My phone had outdated firmware. On the plus side the phone I received was “rooted” probably so they could install the appropriate OS for the region the phone was being sold to.

So what ever I had been working on, sites, documents wiped without my knowingness. Second I really HATE google, and I didn't know this is also heavily based on Big Brother Google. Last on the list also a major problem for me is watching China as they desecrate every thing they touch from poisonous product's, tainted consumables, intellectual theft, rapid growth in military, always having some new strain of viruses, a culture that's beyond rude self centered and dirty, topped off with possession of stolen government defense technology and security clearances. The Swiss company out of all places to make a phone of this nature why pick china?

I later recalled it, added to it, and edited the original saved part. When the message was sent, only a very short portion of the message was sent-don't know why.

We decided we did not want expensive indoor plumbing and a septic system. The house doesn't have any water hook up or electric hook up. We wanted to go off the grid with this home.

When I'm texting someone (when it will let me text) it will send them before I'm finished. It keeps going to another window asking if I want to save or delete the message, or if I want to add contact, or something else crazy like that. It's part touch screen, and starts bumping in your hand to the point that you have no control over what you want to do. You have to completely close the slide, exit out to the home screen and start over. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. I definitely would not recommend this phone to anyone!!!I don't know if it's this particular phone that has something wrong with it, or if it's a problem with all of the Motorola A455 Rivals. Whatever it is, I won't be purchasing it again. If I could afford to do so, I'd swap it out for an LG Cosmos 2, but the purchase price is way too much right now. I'm going to have to deal with this until June of 2012 when I'm eligible for an upgrade....and believe me when I say that ANYTHING will be an improvement!!!I have done many purchases through Amazon, and this is the only time I've had any problems at all....I'm not afraid to buy through them.

He does not use web service and from reading the other reviews I thought...OK, this phone will work for him. He texts and talks on his phone--only. When I received the phone, promptly--as promised, I opened the box and the phone didn't seem ""NEW"". Maybe, more like ""RETURNED"". I did not care. I searched the box for all the items promised in the Amazon listing. And much to my dismay--there was no 512 MB MicroSD Card. The other items were all there...but, of course they were. Why else wouldn't there be a charger & battery? The SD card is the ""extra"" item that I didn't want to have to purchase. Anyway, I thought...I'll just remove the SD card from my son's old phone and put it in this phone (big deal). And that's what I did. This phone though, has a lot of quirks. It erases the ""contacts"" list almost everyday. Some other shady things that I am sure T-Mobile (At&t) tries to do daily to destroy the phones working ability. What I do like about the phone is that it is rugged and sturdy. My son does like the style and the keyboard. I do like that I was able to purchase this phone without adding another two years to my contract with T-Mobile. I think the phone will last about 6-12 months before T-Mobile is able to stop supporting it completely. I would not buy it again, misleading advertising on the 512 MB MicroSD Card.

This is the iPhone copy that has more screen space, less weight and softer feel.People talk of battery life but if you don't have constant updates of all your things (Facebook, email, etc.), I have had my battery last 4 days with not much use (some txting, calls and emails), 2 days with heavy use. I use my phone to call and txt, WhatsApp txt, and check Gmail; I'm not a Facebook maniac, play games (except chess), and have to be constantly checking it; nor do I browse that often on it. I use it to calculate things, unit conversions, read newspapers, translate languages.But you have to take care of your (any) battery: over charge the first charge, you don't let the battery die completely (turn off before that), and after it gets to 100% charge, you disconnect the charger. Anything else you'll kill how long the battery will last.Never thought that I would worry that much, but the camera is great for just 5MP, taking great, vibrantly colored photos.

I looked at the serial number on the back and looked it up and it matches the iPhone 4.

201141,Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,"I haven't been this satisfied with a cell phone since my old Nokia 5110. This is exactly what I want in a cell phone. The battery life lasted me 3 and a half days before getting to 10 percent. My previous cell phone (Majesty 796c) would get down to 50 percent in one day. Also, in my experience, it's quite fast and fluid. I haven't really had a problem with the screen being 720p instead of 1080p personally. Basically, if you don't see much of a difference between a 720p and 1080p Flat screen TV you should be good with this phone's screen resolution. Plus, they actually pre applied a screen protector! Great, because I suck at putting them on. I'm using a straight talk AT&T compatible micro sim card, so I get the 4G LTE service. Speeds up to 25gb up and 10gbs down. That's better than my Comcast connection. LOL If you're going to use it with straight talk service, you will have to set your APN settings though. You can get the settings from the Straight Talk site itself, or Huawei actually posted the settings in the questions answered section on Amazon. The Ascend Mate 2 doesn't have too much bloatware as well. I have about 12 gbs of data left from 16 gbs on board (I added 16 gbs with a SD card for extra space which you'll need to change the settings to save things to the added card by default). Some phones take up half the space for added on junk. As for the size of the phone, it's large. If you like loose fitting clothes with decent size pockets than it won't pose a problem, but I do have it all alone it that pocket. One more thing I'll address is the Emotion UI. Some people have problems with it. I personally have experience with the Ipod touch 2nd gen and Ipad 2. This UI feels closer to the Apple IOS than Andriod. Like having no app drawer, so I can delete an app without searching for it. I just put things in folders so they're organized in a way that can be found quickly. You can change it with a Launcher (i.e. Nero, etc.) but after I tried several launchers I found that the Emotion UI is a better fit for me. In closing, I LOVE THIS PHONE.PS I'm not good at writing reviews, so I apologize for the meandering way I wrote it. This is the longest review I've wrote about a product. LOL",5,43
152512,BLU Studio G LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Black,BLU,"I have used the phone for total of 10 days now. Out of the box, I was really impressed at how solidly made the phone is. I got this as a back up for my older samsung phone ( jelly bean & 3g ). Sim cards ( dual micros ) were easily recognized ( T-mobile and international sim ). Display is bright enough for me, though the 196 ppi IPS will be a turn off for many ( really can’t see much in sunlight ). Camera is 5MP so don’t expect too much ( I use a regular camera since it takes better pics than most cp ). Battery life is great ( at least 4 days on 1 recharge with 30% remaining ) but I only use it for talk, text and reading books. Battery is non removable so you can’t buy an extra one for back up. LTE is somewhat spotty in my city (Las Vegas) with Tmob. It has LTE bands 4,7,17 so with Tmob it can only connect on band 4. I guess it might work better with at&t since it has band 17. With LTE and lollipop 5.1 I can say I got my money’s worth ( unless it gets bricked in less than a year ). Because of the price, I’ll rate it 5 stars.Update: 25Apr2016Battery life now sucks. I need to recharge phone at least every 24 hrs. After full charge, it's goes down to 95 % in 15 minutes. It still works pretty good. 5 to 3 stars.",5,5

260386,Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked,Nokia,"I have to say that this phone is an excellent value in every aspect. It has any feature you could want except wifi but this phone is NOT considered a smartphone by AT&T so you DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE $30 DATA PLAN FEE and you can use the $10 per month unlimited data!! I bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iPhone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous ""Smartphone Plan"" fee. The camera works great even though it has no flash. You just set it to night mode and can get a better picture in low light settings. The internal data is plenty generous and you can also add an SD card for more memory. My husband particularly likes this because it means he can use it just like an iPod or any other MP3 player and it also has the built in radio so he can listen to it while at work (he is a residential/commercial remodeler) if he doesn't want to listen to his stored music. You can still answer calls right from the earbuds while using the radio feature. The touch screen is great, the screen size is great. It has fast response time from input or touch. We have absolutely no complaints at all.Some people might not like the idea of not having wifi, but if you think about it, if you buy any similar phone you're going to have to pay the stupid $30 extra monthly fee even if you do not use AT&T internet. With this phone you can just get the $10 unlimited data plan and be done with it. The internet works great on this phone and is fast in our experience. Very happy with the purchase and the price is amazing. Call quality is great as with all Nokias. No issues whatsoever and highly recommended!",5,13

The phone is a steal at that price, and the price has fallen quite a bit since then.Awesomely thin and light, pretty good cameras, great connection to my service and my Wi-Fi, no more dropped calls or waiting forever for a page to load. Great battery - I use it to play Pandora, FM radio, audible, or Amazon prime music player all day at work and the battery is still in great shape when I leave for the day.I am a horrible clutch, and managed to drop my phone in the toilet the other day. I was bummed, but but glad to see the price fell $50 since I first bought it, so replacing wouldn't be horrible if it was necessary. I stuck the phone in a bag of rice for 12 hours. It came out workable, but with most fogging up both the front and back cameras. I remembered that the sim port opens, so I took the sim / sim port out and stuck the phone back in the rice for another 12 hours. I'm thrilled to say that my phone has been working normally since!My only complaint for this phone is the lack of cases. I chipped the plastic one that came with the phone, and dont really see any good replacements online that wouldn't significantly bulk up the thin device.",5,1

I got home at 7:00 pm and I have the 30% or 35%, and if used with video or something else runs faster.I was surprised FM radio sound is excellent and has the option to record broadcasts.The GPS works smoothly, I noticed even that is not lost both signal and other equipment and has met my requirements.So far I have not had problems with google play and applications, as other teams not very popular brands incompatibilities established, all I installed without problems.I tried to get accessories but are not options, especially silicone cases, but this case was http://www.amazon.com/Luxmo-Vertical-Leather-Holster-Carrying/dp/B008FQT28M and fits perfect.In short I think an excellent dual sim option, just as good as the big brands, it's more I decided that when it goes on sale the blu life, buy one to replace this.The Good:* Dual Sim option.* Good resolution camera.* Good response speed.* Android version very clean.* Excellent sound.* Low cost.The bad.* Block incoming calls when you can hotspot.* Low battery life (common to all smartphones).* Lack of third-party accessories or blu.",5,4

I was scared to open the box after that, but in the store we tested it and it is fine so don't worry if you get this same message.Now for the phone: for the past 5 days and so far I am pleased with my decision.I am impressed with the battery life - I was able to make it almost 2 full days before charging. Now I am not on my phone constantly and so far I haven't let my daughter play games on the phone so that is not a fair comparison to my old phone, but for my purposes it is lasting extremely well. For the most part I am on WIFI - both at home and work so I mainly use mobile data when shopping/waiting. And I am a couponer so I use a lot of apps while shopping. And I usually play Pandora for at least 1 - 1.5 hours per day.That being said what I don't like about this phone is the speakers. Because I have been spoiled with the HTC speakers I don't think most people would mind, but it was a downgrade for me. My cousin has the Galaxy 5 and my husband has the Note 5 and I can't tell that either of those phones speakers are much better.The picture is a great improvement over my 4mp on the HTC, but the image stabilizer is not close to Samsung quality.But the microphone for video is not so great either.Overall I like the phone for the value.

First off knocking a star off right the start because it is labeled as a dual core, not true it is a single core 1ghz MediaTek MT6575 with the PowerVR SGX 531 gpu. AnTuTu does not run, however CPU-Z does and I trust that a bit more. Droid hardware Info also works and says the same thing, plus the camera is listed as a 3.1mp (2048x1536 max res) rather than 2.0mp as per info do that is a bonus. I notice I get different numbers on battery level after charging then rebooting it drops 20-30% not sure whats up with that but I have seen it on phones and tablets too. Device does not appear to be rooted, if you want to root it check out ""Root Genius 2.3.0"" also found through market from an app named ""HowToRoot"" but do so at your own risk if you do not know what root is for you probably don't need it! Now on to the screen, not sure what kind of screen it is but viewing angles limited but still nice enough for the price of the device and the power it has, accuracy and response to touching with fingers is amazing. I thought for sure I would have trouble typing on it when the keyboard came up but I put in my 14 digit wifi pw without one messup! I have not noticed any real lag or delay swiping and messing around tweaking the device overall I am quite happy with it and will be getting one for my son for xmas. I wish we could buy extra batteries somewhere, I have not found any store across the web to carry them... so that bothers me a great deal and tempts me to take another star off, harsh I know but my only resolution is buy another watch to get one and that makes for a very expensive battery replacement!! My review is not yet done I will edit and add more when I pull my t-mobile sim from my note3 and comment on reception, call quality and texting also still need to test the gps but these things do not hold much to my star rating as I only wanted it for a wrist mini tablet for fun and wifi usage.Newsunshine if you change the item listing name to reflect it being single core you will get that 5th star, assuming I don't find a reason to knock another star off by then, do not like being misled.",4,14

Beautiful screen - bright and crisp. Build seems solid. Phone reception actually seems better than my iPhone 5s. And the phone is thinner than my iPhone 5s. I also really like the stereo speaker setup.Minimal packaging. Looks like the phone manufactures are finally getting it. I don't need a huge package with mostly air in it.The bad: Using a speaker or headphones when the phone is idle (e.g. when some music stopped playing, I just got off the phone, etc.) There is an annoying click that seems to happen about every second. When you unlock the phone, it stops, but soon as the screen shuts off, it begins. I can't tolerate it, and have to pull the jack. This does not appear to happen with a bluetooth headset.My camera has stopped functioning more than once now - requiring a power down to get it working again.Android. I don't want to be a hater, but come on, do I really need to give you permissions to things like location or microphone in order to use some of these apps that really don't need it? Yes, I am referring to built in delivered apps. Google, I don't care how much fluff and sugar coating you use to justify the gathering of my personal information. I want control over it. I am hoping that Cyanogenmod will help in this area if/when it arrives for the Robin.Battery life. The screen and phone seem to suck the juice out of this phone. I am unable to get a full day on a single charge. I have tried power management, but it does not seem to help much.Sound. Okay, I get that these are tiny speakers, but still not great.Something new that is happening - twice now the phone did not detect that I have raised to my ear to talk. The first time my cheek must have clicked the speaker phone button - which was a nice loud surprise. The second time I hung up on my call to find that I had somehow entered the notifications screen. Taking a star away.The pretty: Well, it is a great looking phone. I was an Apple fan because of form and function, and the Robin certainly covers the form side very well.Well that is my take after almost two weeks. I'll give it some more time to get comfortable and see if I can sort out the kinks before deciding if it is a keeper (or not).Update May 26, 2016: It is being returned.

2068,"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"I have had this phone almost one year in about two weeks. I wrote a review on Alcatel's website. To my dismay when I checked back on the review I wrote and how may stars I gave it, had been altered. The stars had been bump up from two to four stars and what I wrote edited by shortening the bad part of the review. I was absolutely disgusted. The phone itself is not bad for the price but the customer service is not good at all. I have heard similar complaints. And the complaints stem from questions to do with updates to the phone. The phone came with Lollipop 5.0. They do not respond when asked by customers regarding updates to the phone. Not on their website, Facebook or speaking to them. Speak to them on updates and they have no answer for you. Because of that I will never buy this phone again.",2,3
260679,"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Nokia,"I have had this phone almost a month now and I am still discovering its versatility. It is well worth the cost and does everything I wanted it to do. I have AT&T as my provider and receive a strong 3.5g signal. The phone is light, fits well in the hand and the touch screen is beautifully clear and responds well with the stylus. The reception/sound quality is crystal clear, also. The volume range is very good and the stereo speakers work surprisingly well. The FM radio is a nice addition and I find I use it more than I thought I would. The MP3 player is good; however, their is one thing to note about the Nokia software you use for transferring the files from your computer. It offers an option to reduce the file size prior to downloading the music to the phone but it seems to greatly reduce the sound quality of the tracks, so I no longer use it. The wifi/browser works fine and the zoom option helps to make all print readable. The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots. The manual options have proven to allow for much better quality results so it is best to become familiar with them. This is true with the video recorder, too. For example, indoors on auto mode the video recording is very grainy but when using low light option the results are great...In fact, better then I had expected. The video player was a little disappointing because seems with most of the movie files I have played so far there is some drag periodically which is irritating, especially right after the video has started. I wonder if a more powerful processor is needed or just a firmware update would solve the problem. Despite this I still give the phone a 5 star because it excels in every other regard. And finally, I downloaded the free flashlight software I found on the internet and now this phone can be used as a bright flashlight for times when I need to find something in the dark. I am waiting for a DivX player software for this version of Symbian (which Samsung offers for their phones using the same Symbian operating system) so I can play this popular movie format.When I received the phone I noticed there were 2 tiny scratches on the screen (one was deep), which I couldn't notice until I was outside with the direct sunlight reflecting off the screen. So inspect the phone carefully right away for that or for any other defects. Amazon customer service offered to replace the phone but I didn't want to wait for a new one to arrive. I just wanted to mention it so you know that if you do find there is a problem Amazon is very good about offering support.",5,2
392423,"Sony Xperia Z Ultra C6833 Black (Factory Unlocked) LTE 800/850/900/1700/1800/1900/2100/2600 , 3G 850/1900/1700/900/2100 - International Version No Warranty",,I have had the phone for two days so I will likely update this post. First impressions are that the screen is amazing! Take your LED HD TV and put on a 6+ inch phone. Video quality is awesome! The camera is nothing to get too excited about but it does take manageable photos that are adequate. The photo quality that camera takes most certainly does not meet the clarity and quality that the screen is capable of.The phone requires a micro sim card for T-Mobile. You have to manually setup the 4g network by going through your setting and inputting the T-Mobile network address. I got that off of another active T-Mobile phone.The phone is supper fast and responsive. It is large and can be a little awkward to handle but I wanted a Tablet/Phone so I was expecting that. I would recommend this phone. I have never owned the Samsung Note 3 or Mega but from what I could tell as far as processing speed this phone was just as fast if not faster. I did get a prompt to update the operating the system shortly after I connected to the wireless network.* I have had this phone for a week now. The Battery life is amazing. It goes for ever. I purchased the Sony Case that has the backup Battery pack so it can charge on the go but I am thinking that was not needed for day to day use. The battery is amazing. I have been less than impressed with the speakers. They are average at best but do the job. I think you expect more from the speakers because the picture is so amazing. This is solved obliviously by using head phones or plugging it into some desktop speakers. I need to do some more testing but I think because this is an international version T-Mobile has not been able to dumb it down and restrict it from creating a mobile hotspot. I guess I will find out once I get a bill but I think it is allowing other devices to share the 4g data and I did not have to call costumer care or add anything to my plan.,5,2
265785,"Nokia E75 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, Media Player, and 4 GB MicroSD Card(Silver Black)",Nokia,"I have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. Great phone. Good sound, good voice, fast O.S. Good signal reception all around, though in N. NJ that is not really a problem.I charged it initially at home with the included AC charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included USB cable and saw the phone charging while I was playing with it and synching up my calendar.I swapped my SIM card from the old phone, (HTC Hermes/ATT 8525), to this one and it worked right away. ATT mediaNet needed no configuration even though I had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. WiFi works well in my home. This is my first time using ATT MediaNet so I can't really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. Amazon got an order for a microwave once I got home and I saved over $50. It is nice not hunting for a WiFi signal as I used to do. Glad I finally succumbed to paying for ATT's service. I am not comfortable with Nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. I may try Opera.I can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than I could with my old HTC/ATT Win 6.1 smart phone. Nokia PC Suit is leagues ahead of MS Active Synch, and puts Motorola's software to the shame it deserves.Folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. Instant response instead of a second or so wait as many Windows based phones have.The one issue I have had is I can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. I suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what I do I can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. When you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. Whether I select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. The phone will warn you to use the phone mic. I recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, I am doing that right after I post this. Maybe with more use I can sort it out. I only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since I did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.This brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. I am often on support calls. Sometimes for hours at a time. (Yes, I am an I.T. peon). I did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are NO standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that I can find, they almost all use 2.5. The headsets that do use 3.5 are either iPhone style earbuds, which I find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for PC gaming, which use TWO plugs and are not usable on a phone. Not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. So I am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can't last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so I can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. Slightly disappointing.I do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as I did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. Someday I may try a tablet-style phone, like the E71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.One big reason I got this phone is the number pad for dialing. While touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.If you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. Number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a PHONE, it makes sense. It fits easily into my shirt pocket. I do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like Batman as I would with a tablet PDA.But touch screens are useful. I think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. The screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if Nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.There is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. So there is still more to learn on this.But all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone I have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. If this is an indication of where Nokia is going, they are going in the right direction.",5,26
161430,"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GOLD",BLU,"I have had the BLU VIVO 5R for a month now. I wanted to use it for some time before I penned my review in an attempt to make it as objective as possible.Ok to start off: It is a nice big phone, pretty sleek and with a passable finish. A few people have asked me ""which phone?"", the answer has mostly left them with a ""?"" on their face. So clearly BLU is not a very popular phone in the US market.Personally, I went for BLU coz the specs looked impressive on paper; and I did not want to spend a lot for similar specs from a flagship manufacturer. My honest view is that, its a OK phone, I can't really say i LOVE it, and nor can I say I HATE it. Although, the thought of returning it did cross my mind.Most important difference for any Samsung users, the badge notifications for any new WhatsApp or SMS or missed calls - this feature is absent. As I learnt it after researching, this was a Samsung feature that they apparently copied from Apple. But I have failed to reason why Android does not have this feature built-in. There are a number of skins that claim to enable this functionality, but I was unable to get any of the skins working. I have now just surrendered - and am being forced to getting used to seeing these notifications only in the notifications bar.The auto brightness control/feature while present, is questionable. I have often felt that the default brightness that it auto-adjusts is often lower than ideal required - thus requiring you to manually tweak it often.The camera: while the pictures look better than some of the other models, the pictures don't seem to have the sharp edges when we zoom in. So camera is OK but not really as good as the promise. One serious drawback, the moment you attempt to start the camera app, say when the battery is 15-18%, it just flashes a warning that battery is low and camera cannot be operated and the phone just shuts down! Totally weird! A phone with 3000mah battery switches off at 15% and prevents camera usage!The battery: I use my phone a lot for calls, and then some for whats app and text messages. The battery is good, not great; but will run a day. The only issue however I felt is that it takes forever to charge the battery.Fingerprint sensor: It is nice, and I think this is the only feature that this model had, which I was tempted to go for. Another smart feature is that it give multiple options to unlock the phone. viz. if you are at home, or face recognizition, or few others.Call quality: It is ok, though I noticed I often need to keep the volume to max. Also, weird thing, when I am on call, the phone locks after the usual 30 or 45 secs inactivity, and then when I have to conference or use any other feature. I first need to go to home screen; unlock with my finger and then get back to phone app and then try conferencing. This just adds a 5 - 10 second delay - which irritates me a bit.It has got 3 GB RAM, plus oct core. So speed of operation is not an issue.All in all, its a good buy if your expectations are average+ and you have a tight budget. But if you can live with above shortcomings, its probably a very good phone for you.",4,6

I can't speak to Nokia's smartphones as I've never owned one. The C1-01 is a great phone for someone who just needs the bare basics on their cell phone - Talk, basic texting, and alarm clock. The camera is mediocre, and really not worth using because of the poor image quality. I typically only have to charge the battery 1-2 times per week.

389794,Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty),Sony,"I have an LG G3 in RMA. It just resets on its own. I needed a spare phone and was considering a BLU phone until I found this at 50% off the MSRP. This was a lucky impulse buy which I got at the right time.The phone was the E2306. This thing has T-Mobile's HSPA+ (3G) 1700 MHz frequency (not common) for unlocked phones. It also has LTE bands 2,4,5,12,17 which are the majority of T-Mobile and AT&T frequencies.The phone is pretty slick. I love the aesthetics. It feels dense though. I fear if I drop it, it will break.I had a Nexus 5 (32GB) and LG G3 (32GB) before this phone. So I will use them as references.First item to compare… the screen size and resolution. This phone has the smallest size of the 3 and the smallest resolution of 1280 x 720 (HD). Nexus 5 was a Full HD phone and the LG G3 is a Quad HD. I do not feel that I am missing anything with the lower resolution. How small do you need your text? Everything appears to be crystal clear.Next is the RAM… This has 2GB to match the Nexus 5, and 1GB less than the LG G3. I did not see this phone slow down. I have not been playing any games. I have not been using it at its fullest limit.Next is the storage… this phone has the smallest of the 3 phones with 16 GB. So, this will limit the number of apps you can use and install. I saw this limit on a Samsung tablet and I believe this is the greatest detractor. Now, this also has an MicroSD slot. This is something that the Nexus 5 does not have. So potentially, you can store more pictures and music in this device. The LG G3 wins hands down with 32GB internal with MicroSD card expansion slot. As a spare phone, this Xperia M4 is perfect for me. This could be my daily driver if my LG G3 cannot be repaired. (I no longer have the Nexus 5).NFC… all the phones have NFC, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless N also included.Battery… the battery is not user replaceable. This was the flaw with my Nexus 5 and why it needed to be replaced. The LG G3 wins this factor with a replaceable battery.Processor speed… This is the slowest on paper but it is future proofed with a 64-bit processor. Although it is an Octo (8) core, it is more like 2 quad cores switching between the two. I do not think I am missing the power. It is still as smooth as the other phones.Speaker… The Nexus 5 and this phone has roughly the same location. The LG G3 speaker is on the back. Of the 3 phones mentioned, this has the BEST SPEAKER phone volume and SPEAKER for music.Camera… This has a 13 MP camera. IT IS THE BEST CAMERA OF ALL 3 PHONES NOTED. I have not taken a blurry picture with this phone. It is slower than the LG G3 and about the same speed as the Nexus 5 in taking pictures, but it is worth it for the quality.Waterproof… need I say more. The LG G3 and the Nexus 5 are not. So, I can put this under the sink faucet and wash my phone. This is probably a major reason that the battery is not user replaceable.Other items to note:1. This phone uses a Nano-SIM. This is the smallest of the 3 phone SIM card form factors.2. The native messaging app stinks! Sony dropped the ball on how it handles group SMS/MMS and organizing the received messages on the group. Sony splits ALL the received messages and sending a group MMS requires a subject. Unfortunately, all the replies are still on separate strings. Get another app, like Google Messenger, Textra, Evolve SMS, etc. With all the benefits of this phone, I could not rate this phone below a five star.",5,9

263168,Nokia C3-01 Unlocked Touch and Type GSM Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver),Nokia,"I have always been a Nokia fan, but their basic phones sort of disappeared during the smart-phone craze. This phone was described somewhere as a hybrid, and I have found that this is a very good description. I really didn't want a smart-phone, but this gives me the best of both worlds. Battery life is great, it's an attractive phone, and I can go on the internet if I want to. AT&T doesn't consider it a smart-phone, so I am trying out an unlimited internet access plan for $10 per month. If I want, I can drop that plan and get free wi-fi access where available. The free Ovi mail account is good for folks like me who don't want to ""text"" but who occasionally like to communicate via email on the go. I did have some trouble hooking up to the internet initially, but thankfully there are folks out there (on the web) who have left great trails of useful tips--and so I programmed myself onto the AT&T links. I highly recommend this phone.May 1 update: I'm still enjoying this phone, but buyer beware: I have noticed that this phone ""jumps around"" without my hitting any keys. I'm not sure why, but just be very aware that you have actually ""locked"" your phone, and are back at the main screen when you're done using any application.",5,3

81468,"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",Asus,"I hate to write this review, because I really love this phone... when it works. I bought this phone on Amazon and received it on August 31, 2015. I was in love with the device out of the box: it was large, speedy (I have the 64GB version), and could handle my always-on-the-road work life. Despite a battery that will not last you a full day unless you go with the Super Saver battery setting, I wasn't concerned about this flaw because of the rapid charger. A couple weeks into owning the phone, I began to experience problems. The screen would go crazy out of nowhere. Apps would open and close randomly. The keyboard wouldn't work. The phone would call people when I was several feet away and not even touching it. Usually a reset would fix the problem. As the weeks went on, the problem became more frequent. Now, my phone does this ALL OF THE TIME making it virtually unusable. After doing some research online, several other people are having the same problem; however, when you call Asus support to report the issue, they claim to have no knowledge of it. In fairness, their customer service is responsive and will offer to repair your phone. The downside is that you could be without your phone for a couple of weeks, which is unacceptable for a business user like me. After pushing to speak to a supervisor, I have been allowed to get a new replacement phone, but I have to pay $25 to process the order. This is BS in my opinion: it's not my problem their phone sucks. When I had problems with my Moto G, Motorolla sent me a replacement at no cost. Shame on Asus. I'm a loyal customer who has several thousand dollars on Asus' amazing gaming laptops. Too bad their phone isn't as good. If you get a unit that works, I think it's worth 5 stars, but if it doesn't, you'll regret the day you ever spent money on it.",1,3

I have already had to go to Verizon to have all of my data transfered to the new phone twice and I'm tired of screwing around with Big Box Bonanza.

If this does not get fixed, I will file an FCC complaint, as they are not honoring their promise to fix their defect. The affected phones start with serial numbers with ""505"", these phones are defective and WILL fail. I believe 505 to 507 are all doomed to this error.

The screen sits just below the bezel, and it drives me nuts. The camera is mediocre at best. Using it is a chore, the device is slow and not very responsive, animations are glitchy and slow. The screen is bright and has good color, but icons and text are soft and fuzzy.

That's the first reason I decided to stick with HTC, and the one M8 promise to be handsome phone. Comparing with the competitions S5, as far as performance they are quite the same, maybe a difference in the camera. The Samsung has extra features like the fingerprint scanner, the hart rate monitor, etc that can make the difference if you enjoy having a phone with many feature. But for me is the daily working, and I got to say the phone beats S5 in daily use, the sound is amazing never heard a cell sound like it, the phone is the best looking phone in the market, the screen performs great outdoor with direct sunlight. And about the camera, maybe not that much megapixels but ultra-pixels performs better in low light environments and many pictures are taken in those conditions, in other conditions you will get good pictures. I'm getting about two days of battery life with regular/high use, remember I just got the phone, and when you get new toy, you usually play with it extra time to learn all the features.

So I went to the android side and got this phone because I did not want to spend a lot, but wanted 4g speed. I got that.Physical size is same as the iphone. Screen is fine. Those that say it doesn't view well in the sun, make sure your brightness is turned up. Mine defaulted to the lowest setting and it took me a month to figure out that was the problem.Phone is light. Responsive. Call quality is good. 4g speeds are great, though sometimes I lose a signal, but I think that's not the phone as I live in a dead spot.Transition to Android was entertaining. Not the closed system of Apple, so there is some funkiness that I liken to the PC world, though not that crazy. Rooted the phone to get rid of a lot of bloatware, and I highly recommend you do that.Changed the theme to look like an iphone as I mentally have committed certain icons to certain functions.Battery life is fairly good. I can usually go a couple of days without charging and I use my phone a fair amount.When I was in the tmobile store, I drooled over the Galaxy S2. But in the end, I have an ipad, so why do I need a galaxy. This phone was cheap and highly functional.My only minor complaint is the lack of a better ""on"" button, as the power button on the side of the unit is a little hard to depress at times to wake up the phone. But I can live with that.All in all, I think this is a great 4g android phone for less than $200. Hard to go wrong.Ironically, I tried to buy this at the local tmobile store in my town to support local business. But because of the challenges the carriers have with previous contracts and lots of small print rules governing the prices of phones, the best they could do was $350. Hello amazon.",5,7

I came across this phone on amazon. This phone is not unlocked but it works with AT&T and I have heard you can unlock it by looking for the code online supposedly. I like this phone because when you lock the screen the date and the time appear in large text/font when you hit a button to light up the screen when locked. The thing I don't like about it compared to my pantech is that you can't set it to where you enter your pin number every time you lock your phone. I have my pin set for when I turn this phone on and this is all I have been able to figure out with regards to using a pin # on this phone. So that's a downside that you can't lock this phone with a pin # all the time, just with a touch of a button. Also, I have found that if you text a lot the inbox gets full rather quickly so you have to delete your conversations daily like every other week or so depending on how much you text. I don't mind doing that but some of you might. The battery seems to be holding ok...but I have found that if you use a lot of the applications on this phone like going online, etc. it takes up a lot of the charge rather quickly, if that's the case and how you'll be using it I recommend you take your charger with you. I think I'm going to by an sd card for it in hopes it diverts that away from my battery's charge...I dunno if that will work or not but I think I'm going to give it a try anyway. Maybe it will help with the inbox texting issue...I dunno. Other then that I love this phone. The sound quality is nice and loud. For example, my grandmother who is hard of hearing could hear me on this phone! : D It has all that I need on it. it takes a while to get used to the touch screen aspect of it but you get used to it rather quickly...at least I did. I recommend you buy a screen protector for it as well as a hard snap on case when you purchase this phone all at the same time as you will come to find you need it. I recommend the hard snap on case because if you are a person like me who drops their phone a lot then it will protect it and this phone is so light the case adds a little bit more weight to it (not much) but just enough to where you feel more comfortable holding the phone and more comfortable to the point that you feel like you won't drop it as much. Also, you touch the screen to dial and such so that is why I recommend you getting a screen protector for it. This phone also comes with the 2 holes in it for a lanyard just so you guys know : ) Otherwise I would recommend this phone.",4,23

Also, trying to delete messages one by one is a bit of a pain. I can't find a feature that lets me select multiple messages to delete at one go.Nonetheless, a good offering from Nokia, especially for people who like their phones plain and simple. It's pretty much an evolution of the 6300, although I'd give the 6300 five stars and this four for a few shortcomings.",4,2

I loved the way it looked. I loved the sound and quality of the music and the ease of use between my PC and the phone itself. It came loaded with easy to use software. Not to mention, its kind of cool having a phone that is light years ahead of anything they even have in the AT&T store. I have always been a PDA kind of guy until this phone. This time, I wanted a little more fun phone. Something that was more music but, could handle my on the road demands of email and internet surfing. This phone did all of that...UNTIL! About eight months of having, I started to notice little thing. Like, it kept powering off with the lightest touch. This got so bad, I had to put a little piece of paper between the battery and the case to press it into place. Then, for about a month, I could not SEND text! I could get them, I could send email, I could send pic's, I could not send text. I am not hating on Nokia at all, I am just a little concerned. Would I not recommend Nokia, NO. They make great stuff. I just want people to know little things I have run across since I have had mine. I am very close to picking up the N97 now so, I am not done with them...although I will make sure the service contract is IRON CLAD this time!",4,4

I really like this phone as it is small enough to put in a pocket but with the slide out keyboard the letters are fairly big which make it easier for me to do the typing for messages.

198568,"HTC X515M EVO 3D Unlocked Android Smartphone with 3D Camera, Dual-Core Processor, Wi-Fi, GPS",HTC,"I got this phone to replace my Nokia N8, a phone which despite its gorgeous and sturdy hardware frustrated me to no end. Let's get this over with shall we,I properly hate the 3d feature. It feels like a gimmick and destroys the battery life. However, to account for 3d's battery sucking nature,the phone comes with a greater capacity battery than the similarly specced htc sensation. Because of my abhorrence towards the 3d camera, the phone, unlike my friend's sensation, easily gets through a day of moderate usage(awesome side effect). The only gripe I have is regarding the hardware aspects of the phone, mainly the ergonomics and the display. Talking of the former, the ergonomics of the phone could have been much better. The biggest culprit here is the camera key, which juts out from the side. The design of the camera key leads to it pressing into the skin and often getting pressed accidentally.Putting a case on the phone, however, negates this problem. The display, while of qHd resolution, has very bad viewing angles. Despite saying this, I would take this display over pentile matrix displays like those of the atrix's and the droid razr's every-time.",4,2
277321,Nokia X6 Touch Unlocked GSM Phone with 5 MP Camera and 16 GB Memory (White with Yellow Cap),Nokia,"I got this phone to replace my Nexus one because of AT&T, I have owned Nokia phones for over four years and have had many N series phones. The X6 is a improvement over the other touch screen phones they make, my N97 mini was just marginal and the 5800 was a disaster with others falling in between that, I would have loved to keep my N1 but refuse to pay $30.00 a month for data on a phone that AT&T does not sell, that is why I went back to Nokia and the X6. The X6 touch screen has been improved with kinetic scrolling but it still suffers from poor touch response!I find this somewhat annoying but livable,the screen is bright and clear but not as good looking as a AMOLED screen but then again the X6 does not suffer from burn in like the AMOLED screens do.The flimsey back cover is a disapointment it feels like it will break very easy if not careful, also the three hard point buttons on the front are a worthless design that I am sure will give you trouble in the future, again poorly built. Battery life is marginal at best!!!Call quality is the same as all Nokia phones, it is clear and has great sound, the twin speakers on the phone give it a really good sound when playing music. The bluetooth works great and is very clear and will support voice dialing from the headset if the headset supports it.All in all Nokia has improved the touch screen phone some what, but still have a long way to go, maybe the new symbian 3 on the N8 will bring them up to where they should have been long ago. I think that the limit of only 16GB internal memory is a mistake, I thought that Nokia would have learned that lesson when they made the N95 8GB but I guess not, they should have at least put a HCSD slot in the phone also but I guess not. Also a little better processor would have been better, the lack of power is a little disappointing but again livable!!! All in all it is a typical Nokia with all the short comings that are typical Nokia, something I have come to expect over the years!!!Would I recommend this phone to others?? Yes but with the stipulation that they do not have visions of iphone or Android N1 to compare to because it will fall well short of the mark. For a Nokia touch screen phone it is as good as they get, if not for the kinetic scrolling it would have probably only gotten two or three stars at best!!! I guess it will hold me over until something better comes along!!!!",4,5
152533,"BLU Studio M HD - 5.0"" Smartphone -Global GSM Unlocked -Black",BLU,"I got this phone to replace a cheap Tracfone I picked up at Walmart after I fired my Cellphone company.I just liked how easy it was to switch to Tracfone and shop for plans later so that is what I am doing.I did shop around a bit before I bought this phone and really liked the HTC 530. But to get an HTCphone with the same specs is double the price. Not even kidding.Pros:Stylish all black with a simple styleSleek lookLight although just a tad heavier then the HTC 530 IMOSmooth feelFits in my hand I actually ended up liking the feel more than the HTCScreen brightness is very adjustable it will not disappoint youDual sim card slots if that's your thing. I will probably use it in the futureWas unlocked my Tracfone sim worked flawlessly with itCons:First thing I did was pop the sim card out of my Tracfone and into this.I could not for the life of me get it into the first slot so the sim card going intosim 1 was tricky but it works just fine in the sim 2 slot. I was slightlyconfused because I thought maybe there were different international kindsor something. That wasn't the case and later I figured it must just be anoddly shaped sim so I did get it into both slots in the end.Battery life is not as expected. I guess if you kept it in standby it wouldlast for approx 5 or 6 days? I have both Wifi and Bluetooth on thoughand that starts to drain it maybe 3 or 4 days on standby thenbest guess anyhow.Edit: I have to edit this review after a lot of experimentation and use of the phone.I am happy with the phone itself but I want to warn anyone planning on using thiswith no contract providers inside the USA. You cannot go to Walmart or somewhereand buy a SIM to add this phone to a no contract play. At least not most of them.I have already bought and attempted to return two plans to Walmart with no success.After you purchase a prepaid card they are not refundable by Walmart even thoughfor Total Wireless or Tracfone it clearly states it works with unbranded phones.Not the case here. Unless you can activate the SIM in another phone it will notlet you activate it with this phone. Beware Tracfone and Total Wireless are nowusing bait and switch tactics to steal your money. I suspect you wouldrun into similar problems with other prepaid services.So to sum it all up I would not purchase this phone again and its not because ofits mechanical ability because it works well, but because US cellphone companiesrefuse to accommodate it.",3,12

There's problems with it too like the lock screen clock shows a different time from the one in the corner on the menu/status bar. I think I and my boyfriend have tried all these different loads on the phone (ice cream sandwich, peach sunrise, etc.) with the phone only getting worse over time rather than better.

About 4 weeks later, I got the phone back, the problem not fixed and no explanation. Called again, sent the phone back, 4 weeks later I get the phone back, fixed.

Trying to get something on the screen to move or work can be frustrating because it takes some effort to manipulate, move, whatever. The battery is not as bad as some reviewers have stated.

235780,"LG Optimus L9 P769, 4G (T-Mobile)",,"I got this phone a couple months ago because my older phone (Sony Xperia U) was starting to act up. I decided to order this phone because the price seemed reasonable.For someone looking for a simple smartphone, this will do. Just as a heads up, this phone requires a MICRO SIM card. If you currently have the regular sized sim card, you can bring it to any tmobile and they will cut it for you (for free), so no worries there.It's size is a little bigger than I thought because I was transitioning from a smaller phone. The graphics and colors are pretty good, but I'm no techie, so I guess I can't really vouch for it being spectacular.DISLIKES:-The camera quality is OKAY. Just like any other phone, it works best in outdoor lighting. The front camera kinda sucks though.I was hoping that the quality would be a little better, but it's only mediocre.-I would definitely get a case for this phone because the back of the phone is cheaply made. It's a thin plastic that I feel like I could crack just from bending it too far. The sides of the phone are also thinly lined with some sort of thin metal. I dropped my phone when I took off the case and now the metal part is dented.--also, there aren't many nice cases for this phone. Many designs will not fit the tmobile version because the camera is centered in the back instead of slightly to the side as in the international version.-NOT ENOUGH MEMORY space. Although you can extend the memory capacity with an SD card, that is only for media files. Apps and other things will not be directed to the SD card so the number of apps you can have on the phone is minimal. Also, there are some apps in the phone that can not be deleted because they are preset in there. :(LIKES:-Charges pretty quickly and usually lasts the whole day with minimum-average usages (texting, instagram, fb, etc.)WARNING~ if you are super active on those social networking sites and using apps, your battery will die within hours (it has happened to me.)The good thing is that the charger is small and a USB kind of charger so I can charge on the go or when I'm at school.-Easy (almost no) setup is needed.-Lots of options to customize-Easy to use. My 60 year old aunt likes it and uses it too.Overall, I think this is a good buy, considering its price, if you are not looking for a super fancy smartphone. It is more than enough.",4,1

I was a bit reluctant to buy this as its a clone phone, but I don't regret it at all. Some people don't like the size of it, but you get used to it. The OS runs smoothly, the battery life is fair for a smart phone, and the only thing I can really complain about is the headphone jack. It seems that people have found earbuds that work with it though. The little silver border has also started to peel off too. I bought mine from abc800 and requested white. The shipping took about two weeks and it came in the color i asked for. I do not use a data plan on my carrier so I can't really review the data capabilities and speed, but the wifi is pretty quick. With quite a bit of usage, bluetooth, wifi, and data not on, i have to charge it maybe once every two to three days. I've dropped it twice, one being particularly bad, with only damage to the screen protector. I've yet to find a case that fits on it, but i haven't really been looking. The camera on the back is fair, the flash is useless, and the front camera is also fair. The box came with a flip case, a hard case, the charger, and two batteries. I haven't really had any problems with call quality, though when looking at videos without earbuds the speaker volume may seem low. That probably depends on the video though because I've also watched videos on my phone that I was able to hear just fine.",5,1

Because the phone unlocks if the slider is budged, there was no way to secure the phone from pocket dialing. While I was camping one night the phone called 911 four times even though I had ""locked"" it. I couldn't access my employer voicemail with this phone because it had no hard keys, and the screen keypad presented no pound sign (#) which is needed to get into my voicemail system. And, if my cheek brushed the screen on other voicemail systems, it would activate a number on the screen causing the message to be deleted, passed, saved, etc.So I paid retail to my provider (GCI) for my next phone, an Alcatel qwerty candybar style phone. Although I wanted a non-touchscreen phone, GCI only sells GSM texters that have touchscreen menu systems even if they have hard keys for texting and dialing. This phone had a better locking scheme than the Samsung but it too was regularly defeated in my pocket (but it did not make spurious 911 calls).Both the Samsung and Alcatel are of high quality but I hate them for their touchscreens.So...A couple of months ago I bought the unlocked Nokia C3-00 phone from Amazon. It is a dream compared to my other phones. The radio has far better FM reception than the Samsung or Alcatel; the battery lasts WAY longer than my past phones; the menu system is natural, better designed, and faster than the touchscreens; the keypad is easy to see and has a very good touch; the screen quality is bright and clear; and the phone STAYS locked when you lock it. Call quality is excellent. WiFi is easy and fast, and I remain happy not to spend an extra $30 per month (PLUS data plan cost) to have a smart phone.Two teensy cons for me with this phone, both cheaply resolved:(1) The back of body of this solidly built phone is slick. I don't want the phone falling out of my breast pocket or my hand so I ordered from Amazon ""Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia C3 - Black by Amzer"" for about $10. The case slips on perfectly and keeps the phone comfortably secure while I am on a call; and it keeps the phone in one place no matter where I put it down. It also muffles the Nokia's enthusiastic vibration when I want to be alerted to a call or text but don't want to buzz the desktop.(2) The sound quality of the comfortable and ergonomically well-designed earbuds is muffled-sounding. So I simply substitute the original earbuds from an old iPod. They are sufficient for providing the Nokia's superior FM reception and they sound better than the Nokia buds.When my cell phone contract comes up in a couple of months I will take a free phone if I can get the little Samsung ruggedized waterproof phone for when I'm camping or fishing. But I will keep using the Nokia C3-00 as my primary phone beause it is perfect for my normal pattern of phone usage.",5,1

It turns out the unlocked bands on the phone only last for so long. I use it in Colombia (Southamerica) and the phone is supposed to be unlocked, and it was for the first nine months of use, but now I am forced to spend about $50 bucks on having the phone unlocked again through a tedious 2 week process.

First off, it wasn't capable of taking pictures. I know that international versions of phones aren't capable of MMS in the U.S. but this phone wasn't capable of saving pictures either. Again, I sent my phone back and didn't request a replacement so I am still unsure to whether it was maybe just defective. Also, the touchscreen was extremely hard to use, even with the included stylus. The sensitivity of the touchscreen is probably the deal breaker for me. The features on the phone are great. It's powered by Windows so you get the use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other MS Office software. The phone was extremely easy to navigate and it was easy to organize and close windows/applications because of the drop down menu. Also, new emails and texts were displayed right on the home screen so there's no need to check periodically. Overall, I really like this phone except for the touchscreen and its inability to take pictures.",3,4

And also a sound quality control which controls the sound of the speaker and also the earphones.Camera and FeaturesThe camera of this phone is a 8 megapixel rear equipped with flash. And also a 2 megapixel front camera which is pretty cool for me 8 megapixel is good specially in this phone because this phone has alot of features that you can pick to maximize your picture taking skills its features consist of an HDR a Face beauty mode, motion track mode,live photo mode, and a bunch of thing that's alot to go through but all i can say is the camera of this phone offers alot when it comes to features.Design: I really dig the aluminum design of this phone. Its really shiny and it reflects so great this is one of the things i adore about this ohone because you cant really find a display which is similar to this phone so i really salute the seller when it comes to having an originality. The back of this phone tho is a plastic but it still looks cool and at a distance it looks like its an aluminum back casing so its fine by me i can live with it.MemoryThe RAM of this phone is 1GB which is fine because most of the phone have 1GB of RAM so thats average which is cool. And the ROM is 8gb which is also nice you might think its not enough but in this phone it is because this only have a few permanent apps unlike other phones.Compatible networksAccording to the seller this should work on the majority of networks and i suppose at&t is one of them im not quite sure you can ask the seller regarding this just to confirm.Battery and processorThe battery of this phone is a 2200mAh battery which lasts 6-8 hours of continuous use. The processor of this phone is a 5.1 lollipop and a 1.3 ghz Quadcore processor.This phone is easy to use i think this is made for easy access because you can easily access your music because theres a thing on the homepage where you can play music easily wothout even going to your music app and the camera is accessible also because theres also a thing on the app that displays your camera roll and gives you quick access to your pictures this phone is totally amazing i really recommend this and im really happy about this phone although theres also things that didnt meet my expectations one being the pokemon go not working and also a few things its still really worth it. If youre looking for a substitute phone you can give this a shot its not so bad im pretty sure you wont get dissapointed with thisI received this product at a discounted price and im not compensated, affliated or given any instructions by the seller to give a specific review.

238353,LG Xpression C395 Unlocked GSM Slider Cell Phone with Touchscreen + Full QWERTY Keyboard - Red,,"I find this phone incredibly frustrating to use. When my Sony Ericsson W910i Walkman phone died, I got this LG phone because I wanted a full QWERTY keyboard for composing text messages. I wish I'd just gotten another Walkman phone. The LG Xpression is way too heavy, possibly due to it's having a touch screen. It's not a smart phone and doesn't run apps, and I can see no good reason why this phone should have a touch screen. When I'm on a call, the screen locks almost immediately. If I'm navigating through a phone tree and it says something like, ""Press one for service, press two for sales"" I have to hit the power button to turn on the screen and then swipe up from the bottom to unlock the screen, select the phone icon from the touch screen menu, and then I can press a number. By the time the phone tree has asked me to make a second level choice the screen has powered down and I have to go through the whole sequence again. It's incredibly frustrating.I used to take a lot of photos with my Walkman phone. The photo mode on the LG is run entirely from the touch screen. Activating the phone mode is cumbersome, and then taking a picture is awkward due to the touch screen controls. I used to take hundreds of photos a month. In the year that I've had this LG phone, I've taken fewer than a dozen photos. Because of the weight and clumsy UI, I've basically stopped carrying a cell phone at all, which has its benefits to be sure, so if you want a phone that's so cumbersome that you never want to pick it up, this may well be the phone for you.I give it two stars instead of one because it actually does make phone calls, and once connected the calls seem no more likely to drop on this phone than on any other I've owned in the past.I've learned my lesson. I will never consider another LG phone.",2,3

265652,Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black),Nokia,"I don't understand why so many people are complaining about the firmware. The phone had no problems at all from the beginning when I got the device.I did update the firmware two times (one for each time a firmware was released) and I don't notice any improvements either.Well, based on my experience with the Nokia E90, Touch Pro2, HTC HD2, Apple iPhone 3G, Sony Ericsson Xperia X1, and the Nokia N95, I really think this is the best phone out of all of them.1) Build Quality - The build is alright. There are no wobbly parts (not even the battery cover which people complain about). There is some light leakage on the the upper 'functionality' keys and it is distracting. All Nokia E72's have light leakage here. The Micro SD and USB covers are easily damaged, so you need to be careful when you pry them open. I have not broken these but I can tell that they can snap off easily. But in the end, the build quality on the E72 is very nice and sturdy. The screen also comes with a pre-installed screen protector that can be pealed off.2) Efficiency - This phone does not disappoint in making yourself more productive. The phone is very fast compared to Nokia N95, Nokia E90, and Xperia X1. The back-lighting on the QWERTY keyboard has the perfect brightness. It is much brighter than the Nokia E90's dim keyboard. Because the keyboard lacks a number row and needs larger keys, the Nokia E90 or Touch Pro2 is a better choice if you really need a really good keyboard. However, I was willing to sacrifice the awesome Nokia E90 keyboard to compromise for E72's better features and not-so-bad keyboard. From best to worst, here is how I rank between different keyboards: HTC Touch Pro2 > Nokia E90 > Nokia E72 > HTC HD2 > Apple iPhone > Xperia X1. You will never accidentally turn on your phone and dial numbers when you leave the E72 in your pocket. The phone will never unlock in your pocket (as long as you manually or automatically lock the screen).Most importantly, the Nokia E72 has a better keyboard and better buttons than the E71. There really only is one thing about the E71 keys that are better than the E72 keys. Since the E72 has a mushy optical sensor, using the D-pad isn't fun. The Nokia E71 has a better D-pad (it's more clicky and less mushy). However, the E71 'functionality' buttons are very cramped. I find it two times more efficient pressing the Menu/Calendar/Contacts/Messaging button on the E72 because the buttons are larger and raised. Even the surrounding buttons work well. On the E71 I would press multiple buttons at once. This problem rarely happens on the E72. In terms of the QWERTY keys, the E72 and E71 are very similar. However, the number and Ctrl key on the E72 is larger by comparison. So the E72 wins in terms of keyboard and buttons.3) Battery Efficiency - The brand new battery on the E72 lasts much longer than the all of the phones I've had and used. Furthermore, it is easy to remove and replace, unlike the Nokia E90 and Xperia X1.4) Camera - The camera isn't that good. I still haven't found a phone with a camera that's worth using. From what I can see, I don't think their is much difference between Nokia E72 and Xperia X1's camera. However, the LED flash on the E72 is the pretty good compared to other phone. Of course, I haven't used the camera that much and I am not a camera pro so you can't rely on me in this area.5) Multimedia - the mono speaker on the back of the phone isn't very loud, but it isn't very quiet. It's much louder than the iPhone at max level but much softer than the Nokia E90 (which has amazing stereo speakers). The music player is great, and thanks to the keyboard, I can search through my music library without scrolling. Furthermore, the audio processing on this phone is on par to my laptop. I hear no difference in sound quality between my laptop and my E72 when I use the same headphones. Watching videos on the low-resolution phone is pretty decent and even clear, but because all Nokia comes with a terrible video player, I am disappointed. But thanks to how well a 600 qualcomm CPU performs on Symbian phones, multimedia is very breezy.6) Phone and Organizer - this is an Eseries Nokia device running on symbian. Most Eseries organizer and phone software are same or similar. Well, in my opinion, the Eseries software is better than Windows Mobile and iPhone. Of course one of the main problem with contacts, calendars, and notes on non-touchscreen Nokia's is that you need a good keyboard to be well organized. Well the E72 has a decent keyboard.But in regards other than software, the loudspeaker/speakerphone is very low so conversations will be annoying because it's hard to hear when you are in a noisy environment. Do not get this phone if your priority is to have a good speaker for phone calls in public environments (for music is is decent, especially when you like to hear it in a quiet place).7) Internet - the Wi-Fi browsing on this phone is much faster than the Wi-Fi on my Xperia X1, and E90. I can't comment on other phones. Scrolling through pages on the E90 was a nightmare. This problem is fixed on the E72. It also supports some flash content like you-tube, and for that, it is a very good phone for internet uses. For a non-touch screen phone, it's a good internet device. I actually prefer it over the HTC HD2.8) Price - for 330 U.S. dollars. This phone has the most return to each dollar you spent.If you guys are wondering:A) The accelerometer works with 3rd party software but has pre-installed settings to silent phone calls or alarms.B) The annoying animated-transitions between screens can be disabled in the phone settings.C) Do not buy this phone just because it has a customizable optical D-pad. It's not very good, and the reason I like it is to lock in the 'focus' when I take pictures.D) The Calendar, Contacts, and Messaging keys are completely customizable.",4,5

It is a steal at this price. My son has an apple 6 and my wife galaxy 4- so I have some comparisons to make. It is not quite the phone either of these are, but let's be honest- it only cost me about 90 dollars and has since dropped to I believe 76? It was brand new and works great, I can't imagine giving it less than 5 stars? Perhaps the reviews I saw were people comparing this to 400 and 750 dollar phones? I strongly recommend.",5,1

Very sharp screen, loudest audio from a cellphone I've heard yet and good quality, not tinny like other cellphones. Gets a little warm if you're playing heavy video games, otherwise cool to the touch. The best thing about it is the pentaband radio. I use t-mobile in an area that is split between 1700/2100 and the 1900 conversion. On my old t-mobile phone, I would often get Edge speeds. With this phone I get nothing less than 3G and usually H everywhere I go! And if I ever decide to go back to AT&T or RedPocket, or H20, etc., it's got the 850 band as well.

I assumed it was coming from the East Coast. Description said it was a new phone, in original sealed box with 1 year warranty. I couldn't tell if the phone was brand new. It still had the thin film of plastic over the camera lens but that doesn't say much. The box it arrived in was not sealed and the start-up instructions and box it came in was for a Galaxy S6 plus. That aside, all other accessories in the box were new and original from Samsung, not replacements. The phone was charged and ready to go out of the box. I had to do all of the normal start-up and settings configurations. It is in very good condition, no visible wear. It was shipped via DHL and was expertly packed by the sender in Hong Kong. I really like the phone and had no problems taking to my carrier and getting a new SIM card. Works well, although I am on the ATT network and from what I understand the S6 Active was made exclusively for ATT. Although, the unlocked version will work on other networks. Outside of my shock about where it was shipped from, and the unsealed box for another Galaxy model, I am very please overall. Time will tell but it all seems to be operating beautifully.",5,4

215447,"LG G2 D801 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Black",LG,"I did some research before I bought this phone and I believe this phone best matched my needs without breaking my budget. I wanted a quality phone with plenty of memory and a good quality camera, since it always seems like my phone is the only one I have on me. The 13 MP camera was a biggie for me, and it really takes high quality photos. The internal ""usable"" memory (per specs from LG's website) is 24G, which meets my needs because I upload my photos to Shutterfly often to backup. However, If you are into a lot of games that take up space, this phone may not be for you since the memory isn't expandable. The apps preloaded on the phone are at least useful; I may root the phone when I get brave enough to do it so I can delete Some of that stuff. The preloaded apps are the main reason I gave the phone 4 stars instead of 5, because they advertise it as 32G memory. I was hoping to use the phone as a hotspot for my tablet, but haven't been able to use that since I believe you have to have the higher data plans at T-Mobile to do that. It appears that it would work fine because I was able to ""see"" my phone when I turned on the tablet's hotspot, but internet goes right to a t-Mobile error page. I haven't otherwise had any WiFi issues and I've used the feature every day. The phone is great at multitasking. The knock on feature is a little finicky but how hard is it to use the button to turn on as you would on any other phone? Doesn't bother me. The battery life is great. I get almost 3 days out of a charge. All in all this is a great phone for the money and is as good as current phone technology in most ways.",4,17

I was very surprised by the small form factor and build quality. Feels very solid in your hand and the rubberized coating on the back prevents slipping. The keyboard was a change for me coming from a Blackberry. The keys feel like they were coated in the same rubber coating on the case and are packed really close together with no gaps in between. They have a very soft feedback that reminds me of using an old school rubber keypad; they don't have the hard click I am used to. That being said, I am sure I would have got used to it. I knew the phone didn't come with a volume rocker switch and I overestimated how much I would miss it. Having to pull the phone away from your ear to adjust the volume is a little annoying.I used this phone with my ATT sim card and it recognized it out of the box with no input from me needed. Reception was terrific and call volume was good. I wanted to use this phone only on Wifi because I didn't want to pay for a data plan. The phone asks you every single time what connection you want to use anytime you run an app that connects to the net. This is really annoying and the fact that you can't establish connection priorities is a huge oversight. I took a suggestion and downloaded an app from the Ovi store specifically to correct this but I couldn't get it to work correctly as it kept wanting to switch to 3G or edge after I was out of Wifi range. Adding to the headache, with 3G disabled the app won't work correctly because it has no other network to switch to.The UI is....... I don't know how to describe it. It feels very 90's to me. Its certainly functional but a little attention to ease of use and polish couldn't hurt. The options to change settings on the phone for the most part are easy to access but there are a lot of inconsistencies that kinda ruin the experience. Lots of messages to confirm over and over, digging through tons of sub menus. I was expecting something a bit more seamless.Google offers a sync app that only works for Gmail for the symbian OS. So I setup the Nokia exchange app to sync my google calender and contacts. I followed the instructions on google's website to the letter but it kept coming up with error messages that the sync was failing. Even with the errors, I was getting my email but not my calender or contacts. Frustrating.So the phone is going back and it looks like I will have to spend more money to get the UI and setup experience I am looking for. If you have a data plan and are tech savy enough to find apps and tweaks, I am sure you can get the E63 to work like a dream and come out on top considering the price of the phone.",3,1
238679,Life One X Quad Band Unlocked - 16GB (White),BLU,"I did a lot of research online about this phone before I ordered it. At first I thought all the one star comments were a bit too critical... Man was I ever WRONG. This phone is awful, says 1080p but it's not, YouTube vids only play at 720p and all other vids are also only at 720p. The dual SIM card on this phone is awful. When you dial a number to call there are two green phone icons, one for sim 1 and the second for sim 2. Not too big of a deal but it is annoying to look at. Also if you only have one SIM card there are 2 network notification bars at the top and the second always shows with a red x. There is no getting rid of it. Last is that there is no sign in the next year that there will be an update to 4.4 kitkat. This phone is not as described online and is super slow for having 2 gigs of ram and a 1.5 quad core cpu. BLU inc will not care about any issues regarding these phones and all the techs know what to do is walk you through a factory reset.

I got the phone last week and had it all set up within ten minutes with my ATT sim card I had from the first Blue phone I purchased. It looks and feels great and the reception has no issues on this device. I have to say the extra $50 dollars this phone cost really makes a difference in feel and quality, well worth it. The case for the white phone comes in a greyish black color that looks nice and the screen protector went on easy (I use scotch tape while installing it to help get the lint off screen before placing plastic). When I have moderate to heavy use I do need to charge at the end of the day but if not it stays charged longer.So all in all if you are looking for a phone that looks great feels great works great and is under $200 oh ya and is unlocked I would say to give this option a try!",5,3

Very comfortable. I like the fact that I can access the battery and carry an extra and easily swap it out if I run out of battery power. It has long battery power to begin with so I rarely need to use it, but it's a nice option. I put all my pictures on it so it leaves more space on my phone memory and I can easily take all my pics to use them. Very easy almost similar to using the iPhone.

126747,BLU LIFE ONE X2 - 4G LTE Unlocked Smartphone - 16GB+2GB RAM - Grey,,"I can't honestly give this phone a 5 star rating unless the aforementioned problems with some kind of malware (false positive or not) is resolved.Other than that, this is the best phone you can get for the money bar none. The phone feels solid and substantial in your hand. It's definitely heavier than my G3. You cannot get a better phone for the price when you get the 4/64GB version especially when you need a dual sim + microsd card slot. Most other phones at this price either skimp on the display (ie. 720p vs 1080p), the storage space, ram, or have a hybrid dual sim/sd card slot. That is, hybrid meaning the second sim slot is either a sim slot or a microsd card slot. So if you want a second sim in there, you can't use the microsd card and vice versa (ie. Asus Zenfone 3).I understand that in order for BLU to sell the phone at such a low price, it needed to make some sacrifices to achieve that. And I must say they did it in the best possible way. That is, instead of putting the more expensive and faster snapdragons in there, they used the 430 which is a midrange chipset. But using the phone for daily tasks, you wouldn't notice it. Everything shy of the most demanding games, it performs well. The millisecond differences in load times are not apparent unless you are doing the same thing on a $700 smartphone side by side. IMHO, they focused on what average users want. That is, more ram, more storage, decent display, decent camera, and decent battery life at an affordable price. I don't really care if the browser loads a couple of milliseconds slower than a Pixel phone. Compared to my G3, most tasks such as email, browsing, videos, messaging, and general navigating around Android are so similar in performance that I would consider it negligible. But what my G3 doesn't have is 2 sim slots plus a microsd slot for a total of 3 usable slots for a person like me who travels a lot.The 2 sim slots are dual standby. I have not tested this yet, but it appears that you can only activate mobile data on one of the SIM's of your choosing.... hence dual standby. You can't have data on both SIM's at the same time. Not a big deal for those that use this phone to travel to different countries because you probably don't want both SIM's active anyway. Normally what I would do is deactivate one SIM in the settings rather than fumble with a micro SIM and risk dropping/losing it in the process like I did with my G3. If you need a phone that can handle 2 SIM's with data simultaneously (ie. one for personal, one for business), this phone probably won't work for you.Kudos to BLU for including headphones, a screen protector, and clear case in the box.My only dislikes about the phone is the design. It's top and bottom bezels are big like the previous generation Samsung. In fact, it looks like a Samsung. Maybe I'm just used to the thin bezels of the G3. In terms of design, it certainly doesn't scream ""Steal me!""I was surprised that this thing has an FM Radio in it. You plug in the headphones, and yes, I tuned into my favorite radio station and voila!Overall, I'm really impressed with the phone. But given the inclusion of some questionable software, I can only give it 3 stars at the most. If they roll out an update to fix the malware issue, false positive or not, I will update the rating to 5 stars.",3,9

2305,"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"I came to this phone from using a Nexus 4 for the last two and a half years and my initial impressions were very mixed. Starting with the positive things, I love the LTE, the bigger and more color accurate screen, the battery life, the expandable storage, the dual front facing speakers, and how light it is and how thin it is. All big improvements! I also appreciate the very light touch Alcatel used with their skin on Android. It's almost stock.So many great things and yet it was almost all brought down by an Achilles heel. The thing that really bugged me was that moving in and out of apps was really sluggish and choppy and not smooth at all. All of these things are super smooth on the Nexus 4, which is a 2012 phone. Even swipe typing on Google Keyboard was not great. I came pretty close to sending it back and getting a new Moto G.(I have no proof of this, but my guess is that the phone sends almost all of its processes to the slower of the two chipsets in the Snapdragon 615, the one clocked at 1ghz. Unfortunately there's no ""high performance"" option anywhere that would make everything run on the 1.5ghz chipset. The Nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run Android smoothly.)I didn't want to get a Moto G, especially after seeing (and hearing, seriously those speakers are great) this phone. Thankfully, Android is a pretty flexible OS and I was able to take matters into my own hands and make things more palatable. First thing I did was turn all animations off in the developer options. Second thing I did was I installed Nova launcher and selected the options to make things run ""faster than light."" Everything is MUCH smoother after doing those two things. Still not quite as smooth as the Nexus 4, but probably 95% of the way there. Close enough where I can deal with it and I can enjoy the good things about the phone that I admittedly skimped on in the first paragraph.So I really like this phone now. It's everything I wanted. It just took some tinkering to get there.",4,14

1606,Alcatel Idol 4S - Factory Unlocked Phone - Black (U.S. Version),,"I broke my Iphone 6 plus and I was not willing to pay $750+++ for a new Apple phone. I have to admit I was a little leery of this phone given the fact that I am a long time Apple user. After some careful research I decided on the Alcatel IDOL 4S. It is much more affordable and still delivers the high end experience I was looking for. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone to give this phone a shot. In terms of speed my IDOL 4S is noticeably faster on the web in the same environment as my Iphone 6 plus. In terms of battery I could barely get through half a day on my Iphone with heavy use. My IDOL 4S ends the day with between 30% and 40% of power left with the same kind of usage. When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called “quick charge 2.0”. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called ""AT&T mobile transfer"" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer!",5,54

80323,"ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser Unlocked Smartphone, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage",ASUS Computers,"I bought this to replace my Cricket branded Moto G. I had considered getting the Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 like my wife did, but in the end I decided on the Asus Zenfone 2 LaserI was a little uneasy about getting this particular phone in the beginning. Many of the reviews were mixed and I was not sure that it would be worth the money I was going to spend on it (I can only afford budget phones). However when Amazon lowered the price by $30 which put it at $199, I pulled the trigger and hoped for the best. The 32 gig of storage and 3 gig of memory works very well for this phone. It is fast and it has not lagged yet even with 10 or more apps open at the same time. Battery life seems to be comparable to other phones and if I am not playing games on it, I can get all day out of it without a problem on one charge. It is a little bigger than I am used to but oddly enough it seems to work for me. While larger than my Moto G, it is much better performing in almost every aspect.The notification light is not overly bright, unlike my Moto G which seem to be far too intense at night. The Zenfone allows you to turn it off if you would like but I leave it on for emails, texts and voicemails. I could not turn it off completely on my Moto G.My complaints are mostly minor. The display is very weak in bright sunlight. The overall volume seems a little lower then my Moto G but it is still loud enough to hear even when it's in my pocket. The Zen UI is a little confusing at first. It is an acquired taste but once you get used to it it is not bad. Also the back, home, and recently used apps buttons at the bottom of the phone do not light up which is kind of a pain when you use your phone in the dark. To me this is a big design flaw. Of course most Android users know where the buttons are, but it would be nice to have them light up just a little bit.My biggest complaint would have to be the amount bloatware installed that cannot be removed. I think I was able to remove 3 apps total. you can uninstall the updates and disable them but I am hesitant to do so because I do not know what effect they will have on the operation of the phone.Even with the large amount of bloatware installed, this phone does not lag at all. It has some great tweaking apps that allow you to clear the memory quickly which helps out if you have lots of apps open. Sound quality is on par with other phones I have used and the photo quality is very good.Many people complain about the power button on the top of the phone, but this works out very well for me because it makes it easier to find in the dark. Also the volume buttons on the back of the phone, while a bit odd, also work because with the MoKo hybrid case I am using, it means the volume buttons never accidentally get bumped while it's in my pocket.Solid phone, well priced, good value.",4,1
306193,Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 i8160 Black Factory Unlocked 4GB 5MP Droid,Samsung,"I bought this to replace an aging Blackberry Bold. I really liked the Blackberry but needed a new phone with a bigger screen. I compared the iPhone 4S, 5 and the Galaxy Ace 2, and Galaxy SII. The iPhones just didn't do it for me. After you weed through all the hype, its a smartphone that is more trendy than useful. At over $600 for 4S and $800 for the 32GB iPhone 5, it was too costly for the features included. The SII was too large to fit comfortably in my hand and felt like a small tablet. The Ace 2 had all the features I needed at a reasonable price. I've had the phone for 2 weeks and have no complaints. Would definitely recommend over iPhone.",4,37

197064,"HTC One X Unlocked Gsm Phone, 16GB, Gray",HTC,"I bought this phone two years ago. The worst part about this phone is probably the battery life - installation of a battery manager program is a MUST. The audio beats feature was really cool for this phone - speaker is LOUD - much louder than my newer HTC One m7.I've since retired the phone to my mom - and it holds up well after two years with no problems!Most comparable phone is probably the Google Nexus 4 which still retails for a bit more expensive. I prefer the ""stock"" Android feel so if I were to do this purchase in 2014, I might lean to a Nexus 4. If you're a competent with phones, rooting this was easy and is part of the appeal of HTC. I had Cyanogen on this phone in 30 minutes after I got it running.Nexus 4 might be the best deal in the market now for a smartphone 8 GB version under $100. The 2100 mah battery vs the HTC One X 1800 mah is a draw for me.Truthfully, in this generation of phones you'll want to look at Mototorla's Moto G or the HTC Mini 2 for a similar sticker price.My money is on the Moto G where you can get an unlocked, off-contract phone for $150. Similar and better specs than HTC One X.If you can get the HTC One X for under $150 - maybe consider it at this point... it's an older phone and the budget models of Android phone will eclipse it by late 2014.",4,1

129537,BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 16GB +2GB RAM - White,BLU,"I bought this phone to replace a Samsung S3 that was a few fears old. I had purchased two BLU Windows phones as gifts last year and I liked the way they performed. So, when I decided to replace my phone, I looked at the different BLU phones. I chose the Life XL because it has a 5.5 inch screen and comes with 2GB of RAM. After I unpacked the phone I inserted a 64GB memory card and a straight talk sim card. It took about 5 minutes to activate the phone and get it running. It took some time to transfer my contacts and sms messages from the old phone but that was because I spent a long time looking for a free program instead of buying one. Now for the phone. I have only been using the phone for a couple of days, so this initial review will be updated in the future. The screen is bright and has good color and resolution. The 13 mp camera takes pretty good pics and the processor handles basic functions like social media and web browsing. The wifi connector locks onto my home network fast and stays connected. I tried out Hulu and Netflix and the video played without issue and the screen was excellent. The speakers aren't the greatest but they are loud. They sound a little tinny when turned up but are not horrible. The sound is OK for calls. So far, I really like the phone. The larger screen makes typing and watching videos easier. I haven't had a chance to try out all its features yet but will update this review after I do.",5,7
153891,BLU Studio Selfie - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,"I bought this phone to replace a Samsung Galaxy S4 that I used for about 2 years. I wasn't expecting much at this price point and was pleasantly surprised when my new phone arrived. Starting with the way it was packaged in a nice looking box with BLU's logo. Then, inside the usual manual and quick start guide; these were very simple and not at all in depth. Who reads the manuals further than a quick skim or cursory glance anyway? The typical cheap earbud headphones are also included. I was happy to find a screen protector and protective gel case included as well - and they fit (however basic they are)!The phone itself is similar in construction to my old GS4 and appears to be just as well put together. This makes me wonder why the S4 cost more than 6 times as much. Starting the phone for the first time showed that I had about 75% battery life available and I was guided through the typical set up prompts - wifi, google account, etc. There were only a few ""bloatware"" apps other than the usual Google apps, which is nice. Most of the pre-loaded stuff I didn't want could be uninstalled.There were a couple things I noted when first starting my phone that are noteworthy if you are switching from a big name phone. The first is the haptic feedback (phone vibrates when you use the keyboard) - it has a different intensity and frequency than I was used to; I thought was being shocked or something. Not a big deal; just be ready for it. The other was the homescreen wall paper was not like the picture on this product page. It was black with a design or graphic that made me think at first that I had a damaged screen (not at all the case). Again, not a big deal just be ready for it. The last thing is the touch screen; I can't tell if it's slightly inaccurate or if it's too accurate and I have fat fingers. I don't think I had as much trouble using my S4, but it's not to the point that I would condemn the phone.All in all, this is a solid phone and every bit as good as my big name, high dollar phone it replaces. Money well spent. Good luck finding an Otterbox Defender or similar case for it though...",5,17
275959,Nokia Lumia 928 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows Smartphone w/ 8MP Carl Zeiss Optics Camera - Black,Nokia,"I bought this phone to replace a 928 (that I love, love, love) because I broke my screen for a SECOND time in six months. It's cheaper than replacing the screen ($130) and a cheaper and a better Windows Phone than what Verizon is currently offering (in my opinion). I really wish I had thought of this before I had the screen replaced six months as I was never completely happy with it. It never really 'sat' right and and I had to get it adjusted a couple of times to fix the problem of not being able to hear anything on phone calls.Anyway... the phone is brand new in the original box. It is unlocked. Registering and activating it with Verizon was a simple process and rebuilding it to where my old phone was was just as easy. I was going to go into the store to do that, but I'm glad I decided to do it myself. It is a Windows 8 phone, and I had to do two updates to get to 8.1. My photos from my old phone were backed up on One Drive, and I can access them quickly directly through the app. That doesn't work as well using the One Drive icon in the Photos section. Also had my texts and contacts backed up so transferring them to my new phone was also much easier than I thought it would be.I also bought a better case so hopefully, I won't have to do this again!!It's a great deal. Buy it!",5,2
257400,"Motorola XT-910 DROID RAZR Unlocked GSM Smartphone with 8 MP Camera, Android OS, Wi-Fi, and GPS--No Warranty (Black)",Motorola,"I bought this phone to give my son when he graduates from Basic. I've been playing with it a bit and so far I'm really pleased with it. We've hooked it up to the WalMart Family Mobile plan, which uses T-Mobile, so it appears to be truly unlocked, in case there was any concern there. It uses Android 4.0.4 right out of the box, because I didn't update anything. The screen is nice and fluid, and it's got more bells and whistles than I know what to do with. I think he'll be really pleased. I'd love to keep it for myself, and may end up buying another.The only, and I mean only, thing I didn't care for is the wall charger. It appears to be for European use, which is fine, because it comes with an adapter for a US plug, but that adapter is terrible. It doesn't fit snugly to either the wall outlet or the charger itself, which means it really won't charge the phone unless you hold it in place. Of course, it charges from a computer with no problem, but if you're in the US then you'll probably want to buy a different travel charger for it. Also, the little instruction book with mine is in French. Which I guess means it really is an international phone, so that's a good thing.Oh, one other thing: if you're looking for an Otterbox for it, the Commuter series seem readily available, but the Defender series are more difficult to find. These are different than what you'd use with the MAXX apparently. Just an FYI.",5,2
262024,Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,I bought this phone through the Amazon Marketplace site and the seller was Everydaycell well the first day I used the phone the screen blanked out about 9 times totally blank screen. I also could'nt send out multimedia messages and Nokia customer service told me you have to have the phone configured by your mobile provider. I emailed Everydaycell to let them know about the problem and several days passed by no answer. I called Amazon customer service and she guided me through the procedure I had to go through in order to get a refund. This was my first time ordering from the Amazon site and I feel horribly disapointed with the hassle I had to go through. I sent the phone back to Everydaycell and a note included expecting a full refund of my money. They claim they charge a 20% fee for opened products how is that possible if the only way you can test your product is by opening the package and testing it out. So now I sit and wait to see if they refund the full. If they dont B.B.B. will be receiving a complaint from me from this company. Dont buy this phone and dont buy from Everydaycell!,2,3

It came with the latest Firmware already installed! Also the instruction manual is an English/German Edition, thats another plus! The phone was already set to english langauge too! I was hoping to get the european adapter, but did not, oh well they are cheap to pick up anyway.I have a Motorola Droid; the size and weight of the cookie is great, its smaller and lighter than the droid. I tested my 16GB micro sd card from my droid in the cookie and it recognized the size even though other reviews here and specs say it only takes a 8GB card. That may have something to do with the firmware version update. One thing to note that i didnt see in any reviews here is to make sure you turn on the phone when its plugged in via USB to your PC or it will not recognize the phone...lolI put in a 3 year old Wataniya sim card and it recognized it right away. Altough I havent used this phone yet, I am more than confident that it will perform flawlessly for me in the near future. Im still playing with all of the functions and options of the cookie, so I cant really comment on that yet.

They had the same model phone in the past and loved it (Worked great as a phone and thats all they cared about). When I saw the free $20 Global SIM card offer, I thought it was a good deal.After I received the product, I tried to activate the SIM card over simactivations.com as per the instructions in the packaging. The second step of the activation asked me for a credit card albeit this SIM card was supposedly pre-loaded with $20 credit.I didn't want to do that since the calling rate from India to US was a ridiculous $3.95 cents / min(one of the highest rates, you can buy a local SIM card in India which can be as low as 50 cents/min). I decided not to use this card because its purely an attempt to get you as a customer with credit card in file and start charging you on a monthly basis once the $20 credit runs out after a 5 minute call.If you really want to keep the same phone number across all the countries you travel and don't mind paying a higher calling rate for that convinience, it may not be a bad deal.Buyer beware.

That shows how much I like this phone. Beyond everyone's ravings, here are some points from my personal experience with the phone:1. battery life is not as long as claimed in the product info. My husband's phone lasts about 2.5 to 3 days with one full charge. He uses it for voice calls only with about 30 minutes daily talk time. I typically get more functions of my phone with usually 10-20 short phone calls, a dozen text messages, 10-30 minutes podcast and checking emails with wifi 3 to 5 times a day. My phone's battery indicator gets down to the last 2 bars by the end of day. So I have been charging it daily.2. Good language support but less ideal than iPhone. I bought the North American version so the phone comes with English, French and Spanish. I was able to install Asian fonts on both my phones without much hassle. My iPhone came with the option to change languages out of box.Notwithstanding the above, I truly appreciate the beauty and functionality of the phone - otherwise I wouldn't have bought two!Update 6/13/09: we have been living in China and Europe for the past several months and use the E71s with local service providers (the beauty of an unlocked phone!). The phone performance seems to deteriorate: the phone would turn off by itself - sometimes in the middle of a call about at least once a week. Occasionally, I can hear the other side fine but the other side can't hear me. Not sure whether this is a network compatibility issue. I have been trolling websites to find cures - some suggest doing a complete software upgrade. I am seriously considering it even though I may have to spend more time to configure it the way I like.",4,3

It was too ancient for me (I am 25). I found it really hard to put my 250 contacts in it, take small notes etc. So I swapped it with my husband. He is a computer science professor.

295704,"Posh Mobile Memo S580a - 5.8"" Display, 4G H+ GSM Unlocked Smartphone - 1 Year USA Warranty - Black",Posh Mobile,"I bought this phone because although I really want the Samsung Note 4, I like no-contract plans and I can't see me paying tons of money for a Note 4 just to have a non-contract phone. Since this phone was only $99, I thought it couldn't hurt to buy it and see if I would like owning a phablet. Overall, I recommend this phone because you can do so many of the same things you can do with the more expensive smart phones, although I can see how this phone's quality isn't on the same level, but who cares when it costs $99 as opposed to $699. I do seem to be having some sound issues with the phone, which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. Below are my likes and dislikes for the Memo S580:-PROS: It comes with everything you will need for your phone, including the pre-applied phone screen. I like the larger phone size; videos are so much easier to view. It's fast. Even though the phone is not a well-known brand, I still feel like I'm using a well-known brand phone. It has a built-in radio. I can block phone numbers. The front/back facing camera feature is great. Haven't had any issues running the apps I've downloaded. I keep finding new features to use everyday. I feel like it was truly worth the $99 I spent on this phone.-CONS: 512 MB, sometimes the ring tones or alert tones are cut off midway, as though there's something wrong with the speaker/sound. When I use the silicone case, it's difficult to press the buttons on the side. There aren't many cases to choose from for a phone this size. I wish Posh would've designed some cool cell phone cases for this phone. There isn't a comprehensive user manual to learn about everything this phone can do. Sometimes you think you've taken a picture but it didn't process. Still getting the hang of how long I have to press that button.",4,80
213215,LG enV2 VX-9100 Black QWERTY Cell Phone for Verizon Wireless,LG,"I bought this phone bec. it's exactly like my last phone, which I loved. Didn't want a smart phone, just a simple phone to call and text. The last one worked great for over five years until it simply wouldn't hold a charge any more, even with a new battery. Since the phone is an old model, I hard a difficult time finding one that was brand new (I didn't want to buy a used phone). But, after months of searching, I FINALLY saw one advertised as new. It was the ONLY phone like this that I found that was advertised as new--not refurbished--but never used. But it was too good to be true. As soon as I rec'd it, I could tell that it was a used phone. The seller had stuck some stupid clear plastic over the screen and other places that are typically covered with that peel-off protective plastic coating that comes on new phones. It was flimsy, cheap plastic coating that looked like it had been peeled off another phone and stuck onto the phone I just purchased. Also, the phone was not in an LG phone box and it didn't come with a manual or anything else. To make matters worse, I wasn't able to transfer my contacts, even though Verizon assured me I could, either by their cloud technology or by taking it into one of their retail store. No luck with the cloud so I took it into a Verizon store, but they were unable to transfer my contacts, so I had to manually re-enter hundreds of contacts from my old phone to the ""new"" phone (newly acquired, anyway). I should have known better than to believe an unused phone of an old model would suddenly appear. I paid a new phone price for an old, used phone. Cosmetically it looks new, but the keys stick and I keep getting weird messages like ""acquiring application info."" Probably the seller didn't completely remove all the application bits before selling it to me. But it works, I'm familiar with it, and I don't have time to send it back and shop around for a new phone. I needed a phone bec. my old one was dying fast and I don't have a landline. I got ripped off, but don't have time to return it to the seller and can't be without a phone.",3,5

Before this I was using the 5s, and in comparison with speed & processing power, this phone is like lightning. I've noticed that photo quality is a bit better-probably because of a higher res screen-as well, but not too different. Also, I accidentally dropped this phone in water (it was fully submerged for a few seconds) and it made a FULL recovery! I dried it out for a day, and at first there were a few hiccups with the screen, but after a few charges, everything's performing just as well as it had before the incident. So apple did deliver with their promise to up their water resistance! My mom had done the same thing I did a few months before with a 5s model and that phone was 100% ruined by water damage.However, this new iOS 10 software (that i had unfortunately no choice but to install) is a complete disappointment! I really enjoyed the iOS 9, and there were a few minor tweaks to that that apple could have done instead to make a more superior iOS version, but I feel the ignored all that and just took it in a completely different direction. They're mostly just small irritations (like how swiping to unlock is no longer a thing), however.",4,1

I bought the phone and started to use it but my data package (Internet) was NOT working at all. The WiFi was working, but the data package was not working. I returned the phone on my expense and it cost me $26.61. They deducted $25.00 from the price I paid for the phone!!! I emailed them and said that it is not my fault that the phone is defected!! They said it's not defected because we tried it and it works!! I said I went to t-mobile themselves and they checked all the APN settings and they said it's fine, but still the phone hasn't worked. They said this phone is not unlocked properly!! I told them I don't buy an UNLOCKED phone so that it works on some carriers and not on others!!! An UNLOCKED phone should work on all carriers and everywhere!! Then why am I paying the whole retail price if I won't have a phone that won't work fine on all carriers!! The guy I email from this company kept saying that they tried this phone on AT&T network and it works fine!!! I don't use AT&T and I want it to work on t-mobile not AT&T!!Bottom line, they just stole $25.00 form the price of the phone and made easy profit from me and most probably others by deceiving the customers and putting untrue information about their products and then you return it (on your expense) and they take the restocking fee and the phone is back to them and they resell it again and again!!!",1,6

The phone acts as though nothing in the SIM card slot even when there clearly is something in there. I have to send it back because it doesn't hold a charge for a decent amount of time and it doesn't allow me to make phone calls or send and receive texts which basically defeats the point in having it.

At the first day of this weird behavior the phone did it like two times at the day. But then next day it went crazy, it had the same behavior but now the phone displayed it was plugged to the charger and then 1 second later it was not and it did it until I turn it off. I tried by removing the battery and give it the phone a rest like 15 minutes, then I put the battery back and turned it on again. It looked like the issue went away but one hour later guess what. It started again. So GOOD BYE, nice to meet you worst phone ever. I am returning it to Amazon. Although it was fulfilled by amazon the phone was sold by a third party, so check that first.",1,25

I have a Blackberry for work and had a SonyEricsson for personal use; they have been banging around in my pockets along with my keys for close to a year now without a single problem or scratch. After half a day in that same pocket with the blackberry and keys the Nokia's screen is already scratched. This of course means they skimped another $1 on the coating for the screen and we all know the result.Features...I chose this phone because I thought I'd be able to use it with Skype anywhere I had a wifi connection and sometimes I can, but for the most part the reception is shaky at best when and only when it connects correctly and doesn't kick me off the network. I also had my SE connected to my car (Audi A4) via Bluetooth with a great function that let me read my phonebook from my car nav screen. The Nokia can't do it!! This really upset me so I did some research and discovered that Nokia did not include the complete Bluetooth stack in the phone and will not update this in the future. One would think that adding another small bit of software to create a better product would be a good investment, but apparently Nokia thinks differently.Battery Life...The battery lasts for ages and I will admit they did a great job with it. There is one thing about charging the phone that I do have a gripe with. This phone cannot be charged via USB. It has the connector for mini USB, but its only for data, a separate plug is needed to charge the phone. This of course means carrying around more cables. yay.Camera...The SE w810i I had also had a 2megapixel camera, but it had things like Macro and Autofocus so even though this phone has a 2 megapixel camera good luck using it without any kind of options or functions. I tried taking a picture of text as I often did with the SE to save some time and the hassle of pen and paper, now I can't even do that because this phone can't focus.Reception...The reception is great BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT 3G!!!!!!! Yes it is 3G in EUROPE, but ATT uses the 1900 UMTS frequency in the USA for 3G so it will not work with 3G in the USA. Goodbye blazing fast speeds when there is no WIFI.I had a Nokia a Long time ago and though it might be time to give it another try, but I think I'll wait another 5 years to try them again.",2,19

I had hoped to be able to resell it at that point, or maybe give it to family member who didn't have a smartphone yet. It worked well for maybe 3 months.The phone FEELS well built. It's small, compact, and you get the feeling it would survive a fall very well, although I never had the 'opportunity' to test that. Having a full keyboard is nice, although the keys feel a bit weird. You have to press down on them a little harder than you would think, and some of the button placements are a little weird, which lead to a lot of prematurely sent messages while I was first get used to it. Compared to the keyboard of the Samsung Glide, which is the phone that I replaced this one with, it felt awkward, although one could probably get used to it within a week or two.The interface is nice, and using a touch keypad for dialing was a nice bit of functionality as well. I do kind of wish they had expanded the touch functionality for other things however, maybe for some games, but it wasn't too big of a deal.However, all of this was rendered moot once this phone decided to have problems calling people. More often than not, I would be unable to have a conversation with anyone. I would try to call someone, but then I would be unable to hear anything coming through. People could hear me, apparently, but all they heard was me asking ""Hello?"" over and over again, trying to tell if it was working or not. I soon learned that if I couldn't hear the phone ringing within the first 5 seconds of calling, I would have to hang up and try again. Once I could hear their phone ringing, I would stay on, assured that I would be able to hear the other person, assuming they would answer. Oddly enough, I don't recall having this problem when someone called me, only the other way around.Luckily my phone only started having problems just before I was eligible for an upgrade from my carrier. I don't really regret getting this phone, but I certainly wouldn't get it again. It's a nice phone for the money, but it seems like, based on my own experience and some of the other reviews, it's a bit of a risky purchase.",2,1

270170,Nokia Lumia 820 Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 OS Smartphone - White,,"I bought this as a trial, I've used BB7, BB10, Android, and now WP8. I found things about every one of them that is preferrable to the others. I don't like the fact that this is an unlocked AT&T phone, that should be noted on the product page (not that it's 'factory unlocked').The flow of the OS is quite simple and easy to use, everything is in alphabetical order in the apps list, and the Start screen lets you put whatever apps you want on it and in any order. One weird thing about the 820 (WP8?) is the back arrow vs the Windows button. If you use the Windows button then press the back button it will return to the program you closed (doesn't happen on Android). There are many very useful apps for this OS. Offline maps and translators are quite useful when you're traveling, especially when they're free.The phone itself is nicely designed, simple and clean, and the build quality seems good. The battery cover is a bit difficult to remove (make sure you have everything you want/need to put in when you do this, so it's only required once). The camera is very good and the pictures are clear. For the individual who sat on his phone, it's not shocking at all that it broke, and quite uncertain whether Gorilla Glass would have made a difference.",5,31
289622,Pantech Breeze C520 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone,Pantech,"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my 8 year old Pantech Breeze II, which finally died, so I could use it until I picked out a smart phone later this Fall. I thought I was getting the same phone I had before. Instead, I got something that looks like a relic from 1998, and probably is.The phone has been charging for three hours: still not full.By default, there is an annoying BEEP every time you press any key. Think about how annoying this would be. Then, think about the extra, pointless battery drain. This is a throwback to when most people were unfamiliar with mobile phones and would want to hear a noise when they dialed. Now, it is just annoying and wasteful. We managed to turn that annoying sound off...by setting the phone to vibrate only. So, now I have a choice: if I want my phone to ring when someone calls me, I have to listen to the beeps for every key press. If I don't want the annoying beeps, my phone won't ring. Lovely.Another irritating and archaic feature is the address book: there are six AT&T numbers like ATT&T Now and Pay My Bill that sit at the top of your address book and cannot be deleted or moved. With the Breeze II, at least those moved to the bottom of the list when I entered numbers I might actually call, but with this outdated phone, they stay at the top.I could go on, but why? The Breeze II and Breeze III are decent clamshell dumb phones if that's what you want. This is a decade out of date, horribly designed, and badly overpriced. At $20, I would not feel ripped off. At $68, I feel like I've been had. This is getting returned tomorrow Run screaming from this ancient piece of junk. You would be far better off with a refurb Breeeze II or even just a contract phone. You are not saving any money here. You are only going to be frustrated and unhappy.",1,4

191963,HTC One M7 32GB GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Black,HTC,"I bought the phone for 200 dlls with BuyME LLC. First: The phone came in box with all the accesories, like new. As soon as I opened the box I noticed there's no manual nor written warranty, made me suspicious. Checked IMEI with HTC customer support and it's a used phone, activated in 2013 and out of factory warranty. So idk how but they sold me a used phone with the price of a new one.Now, the phone: I've used only a week and it's not really what I expected. I did search reviews and thought it was a good deal BUT:1) Earphones broke when I tried to change the earbuds, pretty cheap looking and aparently cheaply made.2) Camara sucks. Does not have many options for scenes. You really have to make an effort to take a nice pic in daylight or indoors. Not what I expected.3) Beats audio sucks. The first thing I tried was the speakers and the music didn't play clearly a lot a WHOOSHY sounds. Disabled beats audio option and solved the issue, now they are regular speakers and obviously regular functioning. Dissapointing because this was a highpoint for the makers of the phone.4) Battery last a day only. Also the system doesn't let you disable many options that consume batery.5) Cant make Call profiles like Office, House, ETC.... that in other phone lets you decide the rigtone for every profile, the volume, etc. You have Normal, vibrate, silence. Thats it. And you have to use the same volume for every notification (email, message, call, on/off)6) HTC sync manager sucks. It was really tardy to set up the phone using this program. The good thing is that you can easily retrieve data from iphone, which usually is a hassle. Still, transfering music into the phone delayed so much! Its not a friendly program. At the end, I used USB conection and just copy/paste music and pictures.Overall a pretty phone but not worth it, and doesn't live up to the expectations. I've had cheaper phones that perfomed better. For me it was a bad choice, hope I could return it.",2,1
197971,"HTC Status ChaCha A810a Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 5MP Camera, Wi-Fi and GPS - US Warranty - Silver",HTC,"I bought the phone because of the combination touch screen and key pad. The design fits my needs perfectly, however the memory is a huge fail. If you would like to download more than 1 or 2 apps, this phone is not for you. It comes pre-loaded with many applications that take up most of the storage space and they CANNOT be removed nor can they be transferred to an external storage card. I purchased a 32 GB card, only to find out that the pre-loaded applications cannot be transferred. I have spent many hours on the phone with an HTC representative who has basically said the only way to solve my problem is to remove the 2 apps I downloaded or just do a total and complete system wipeout to bring the phone back to its original state, which means all pictures, messages, phone numbers, favorite places, etc. are gone. It is a hassel to deal with the phone because I constantly get low memory messages, and I only have 2 small applications that I was able to download on it. I have tried to download additional apps, just to receive a message stating that there is not enough internal memory. While the phone does give me the option to maximize more space by moving items to the data card, once again, the phone will not permit items to be moved. I am constantly clearing out the cache just to access some of the phone's basic features. Also the phone will go on mute in the middle of a conversation when I have not touched the screen, (many times I will be on speaker) and the only way to unmute the call is to hang up and re-dial. In regards to the speaker, the quality is poor, it barely amplifies the sound. If you are still considering purchasing this phone, do yourself a favor and check out the internet blogs about this phone model and memory issues.",1,8

The GPS software, however, leaves much to be desired. See details below.Voice/Internet/WiFi work fine:-----------------------------The voice worked fine with T-mobile and AT&T in the US. The signal strength and voice quality are excellent. However, these companies either do not offer Internet access to prepaid customers, or if they do, their staff had no idea how to sell and use it. I used the E71 with O2 on a recent trip to the UK. The O2 staff, in contrast, were exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful in setting voice and Internet access in minutes; I paid 15GBP and had unlimited calls to the UK and US as well as Internet access which is where the money went.The WiFi access is terrific and I have used it heavily while travelingand at home to handle email and web access. The E71 discovers WiFi networks quickly and attaches to access points instantly.GPS Software Leaves Much To Be Desired---------------------------------------The GPS software is very unfriendly. I preloaded a map of London before traveling; when I arrived I found that only sections of the city werepreloaded while major other sections were missing; it was not clearhow to get the other sections, short of getting a map of the city andentering addresses in the missing parts. Then, when I tried to use thenavigation feature it got the route all right and the position of the car reasonably well, but, surprise, there were no voice instructions. I checked the manual and could not find how to get the voice to work. Fortunately, many other users that struggled with the problem posted solutions on the Internet. Do not expect the GPS to work like standard GPS. It does not provide visual directions for traveling; when it loses the satellitesyou may need to stop the car and push menus to get it to work again; etc etcThese are all results of poor software design...",4,4

We are not wealthy people and cannot afford to pay $800+ (x2) for phones. So, it all boils down to.. cheap phone, non-existent instructions and I'm out $200.00.",1,6
223929,"LG G4 Unlocked Smartphone with 32GB Internal Memory, 16 MP Camera and 5.5-Inch IPS Quantum Display for GSM and CDMA, US Warranty (Black Leather)",LG,"I believe this phone has different models stocked at different Amazon fulfillment centers. I searched tirelessly to ensure that the phone I bought would be 100% compatible with AT&T, but upon receiving the phone and taking it to AT&T I was informed that the phone I purchased (model US991) is a CDMA phone and is not capable of 4G LTE speeds on AT&T's network. The representative at the AT&T store worked for 45 minutes to try to program the phone to work properly but it will not. I spoke with Amazon customer service and they sent a second phone but it was still model US991. From seeing other people's reviews, I think if I lived closer to a different fulfillment center, the phone would have been a GSM phone instead of the CDMA phone I received both times.The phone itself is incredible. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday (his previous smartphone predated our four year relationship) and was honestly hoping he would dislike it so I could take it off his hands.

I finally managed to put all the maps I wanted and the guidancevoices and it works well. I would not recommend the phone if it were more expensive(I paid $149). There is no WiFi.

Home screen panels let you put shortcuts and content all in one place. You can use it as a mobile hotspot with the JoikuSpot app. Ovisotre has a good amount of additional apps, and there are a lot of Symbian applications that can be installed from the PC or directly in the phone. The full qwerty keyboard is very nice and the battery life is good even with moderate to heavy browsing gps navigation. you can also carry a spare battery. the camera is good by smartphone camera standards.Cons: I have not been able to hook yahoo, hotmail or gmail account with the built in email program, I had to use a third party app called Emoze. Too bad the built in app can't be used as a regular pop3 / imap client. The built in sms messaging app does not support threaded views, you'll have to buy an additional app for that (ThreadSMS - at least it is cheap). You'll want to replace the included 2Gb micro sd card (almost filled with OviMaps files) with a bigger 4Gb or 8Gb one if you are planning on uploading many music files / videos, etc. you cannot charge the phone via the usb port.

309816,"Samsung Galaxy G920F-S6 32GB Factory Unlocked 5.1"" - International Sourced Version - Black",Samsung,"I am evaluating the Galaxy S6 920F through a narrow lens. We upgraded to Galaxy S6s from Galaxy S2s, and until now, we have purchased our phones on contract through AT&T as our carrier. We bought two phones through Amazon (Tek Deals). The phones arrived on time and in sealed boxes with a separate two prong European to US power adapter that fits on the European round pin charger. In both phones, the adapter fit too loosely over the European pins, and appeared unable to stay connected with any kind of minor jostling of the cord. Fortunately, the adapter was easy to take apart and I used a pair of pliers to squeeze the spring clip legs together, which easily fixed the problem. Of course, the adapter does make the charger stick further out. Our old S2 chargers will work, but the charging rate is lower, because they are only 1A chargers, rather than the standard 2A fast charger that comes with the S6. We took the phones to our local AT&T carrier store, and obtained SIM chips; I was pleased that the SIMs and switch over was free ( at least in our area).Coming from the Galaxy S2 to the S6 constitutes a big uptick in speed of everything, from downloading to app loading and operation. The screen is not only larger, but as expected, much sharper. We downloaded the Samsung Smart Switch mobile apps to the new and old phones to transfer as much information as possible. The app worked great. Google accounts transferred seamlessly, but some other accounts manually updating the username and passwords. Of course, all the wifi routers passwords had to be added manually.One feature missing on the phone, which apparently exists on US carrier branded phones, is the ability to alphabetically arrange apps with a one button click. At this time, apps are organized by when they were downloaded. App reorganization is a manual operation that can take quite a bit of time.I was used to seeing 4G/LTE on the notification panel on our old branded S2s, but on the 920F, only ""4G"" shows up. This worried me, despite researching that the necessary channels for 4G/LTE are active on the phone. From reading, and I believe, editing out misinformation on some sites, the international version only shows ""4G"", which is ""4G/LTE"".As noted by others, updates seem to just keep coming over a couple of days, but compared to an S2, the updates happen several times faster.The phone is slippery; wife already dropped hers once, and it was only one day old! Fortunately, no damage. New case will help.A concern, like for others, was battery life. It is often very difficult to compare usage from other users, who too often complain about battery life, without a hint about their usage. We live around 1/4 mile from the nearest cell tower, which is line of site, so 4G communication is quite good. Our wifi routers are generally within 50 ft of where the phones are used in our multilevel home. Wifi is used on an intermittent basis for updates or adding apps or heavy browsing sessions, to ensure staying under our carrier plan data cap. I am definitely a low level user, checking weather several times a day, reading and composing a few messages a day with or without attachments, an occasional email, and taking several camera shots a week. Syncing is set to automatic. I do not listen to music on the phone, or watch videos during the test periods. I may average a couple of calls a day. I may use a browser several times a day in either 4G/LTE mode or wifi. There were a number of updates or apps downloaded during the test measuring periods.. With power saving mode activated, I monitored my average battery usage over several charges. After 32 hrs battery reserve was down to ~65 %. Somewhere between 46 hrs to 67 hrs, battery reserve was 53%-56%. A worst case was leaving wifi on for about 10 hours, which drained the battery to 65% capacity in 23 hrs with minimal use (mianly overnight). Obviously, as a low level user, close to a cell phone tower and wifi routers, these values represent a minimal battery drain comparison baseline. I can get away with charging my wife evey second day. My wife's usage is greater, but even in her case, battery usage was similar, and she could charge every second day if she wished, but she is used to charging her phone every day anyway. For those whose life is not marginalized by their cell phone, I would say battery life should be quite acceptable and noticeably better, especially if upgrading from a smart phone that is several generations (like three years) back. Compared to our S2, my impression is that wifi mode does not drain the phone battery nearly as fast as our old S2s",5,4
272027,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked 4G LTE Windows Smartphone w/ PureView Technology 8MP Camera - Black,,I am completely blown away by this phone. More than what I was expecting in a phone. The only thing I am having a bit of an issue with is the music sync. It could be me but I am pretty computer savy so I doubt it. I synced my music to the phone from windows media center and when I try to play a song it says the phone does not play this file format. I checked with the guidelines and the phone support and it says it does. so there is clearly something wrong. Because wmc files are support for this phone. I am sure it will get resolved. I am a huge music lover and I have a large extensive music collection. I would be more than disappointed if this does not get resolved. Needless to say microsoft hit a home run on every other aspect of this phone. It is more like a computer experience than a phone. So .99 percent blown away by this phone. All other applications worked flawlessly. It has online and offline sync you just need to configure it. Both Microsoft and Nokia have downloads for this.

90518,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,"I am another user who does not fit any of the stereotypes or expectations for this phone. This is my first Blackberry phone, I'm not using it for business (I don't even work at a corporation), and it's my only phone. Why did I buy it? I consider touchscreens to be an interface downgrade. It's not a tradeoff I'm willing to make, because I only rarely use a cell phone for games or watching movies. This phone's interface, from the keyboard to the call/hangup keys, play/pause/skip/back keys (via the volume keys), etc. is truly excellent and the best interface in a phone I've ever had, both hardware and software. I am a heavy MP3 user and there are physical keys which support this even when the screen is locked, something I really appreciate. Interface is really important to me and is the main selling point of this phone in my opinion.Music playing aside, I only use phones when I need to do something - look something up on the Web, get directions with GPS, text somebody, call somebody, etc. The old stupid phone it replaced could do almost all of those things, but only poorly. So I bought something that makes all those things quick and painless. Videos don't fit so great on this screen (although the screen itself looks very nice), and I imagine some games won't work very well either. But if, like me, you use a phone as a tool and not a toy, this is probably the best one available.",5,14

If you live in the US and looking to buy a smart phone such as Samsung galaxy 2,3,4, note 2,3 etc, you don't have to purchase an unlocked phone, all you need to do is to purchase a sim card from straight talk, tmobile, so on then get your sim card activated then insert it into your att or tmobile devices , no activation is necessary especially for the pre paid users. All you need to do is to set your access point under settings. Get your att or tmobile devices from amazon(not a third party) or any major retails phone company in the US...If I unlocked if it's inevitable for you, pay a 20 dollars online to get your phone unlocked. Again, I purchased a galaxy note3 just like when I purchase my galaxy 3 lock...and purchased a sim card from straight talk I guaranty you 110% if you purchase att or tmobile phones and you have a straight talk sim card, you won't need to unlock your devices(only speaking to the US prepaid customer) just activate your sim card and that's all you need. if you are not in the US, I recommend you to buy your phone from amazon(not third party) or Us retail stores and pay 20 dollar later online to unlock your phone, you will have full warranty on your devices and no risk of losing your money like I almost did.",1,51

I added a 32Gb SD card to it and it functions well. I can play 1280x720 HD video flawlessly from my SD card. I’ve not installed games on it so can’t give an opinion on game performance.Its an excellent device for its price. I did find a suitably sized case for it here:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AVI1AY0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1And maybe some suitable screen protectors when the one that it comes with expires:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KKYN4OE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Ok, so whats the problem? The reason it loses two stars is because of the default Launcher that comes installed on the phone. A Launcher is just a platform that is used to launch your apps, display your wallpaper etc. The default launcher is “Cool Launcher”. I Installed a malware checker on my phone and it identified Cool Laucher as malware. Now, this could have been a false positive, so I looked into it further and replaced Cool Launcher with Google Now Launcher.However, Cool launcher was still active and I monitored its wi-fi access and activity. Turns out its trying to connect to a server owned by HICHINA ZHICHENG TECHNOLOGY LTD. This company (allegedly) has a poor reputation, so I am concerned that Cool Launcher is spying on me.Now, you can take steps to get rid of Cool Launcher or “sandbox” this app so its not a deal-breaker for me, but I am knocking off two stars for this reason. There's also an app called Suxin messanger that I got rid of.",3,4

315815,Samsung Galaxy J5 J500M 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - Gold (International Version),Samsung,"I am a long time fan and user of Samsung Galaxy phones. But the ""S"" models have frequently been, in my opinion, over priced for a straight purchase without contract. The Samsung Galaxy J5 model is just the right phone at just the right price for me, about $170.00 on Amazon at the time of this review. It supports 4G LTE bands in the US and Europe as well as the European 2100 band for 3G in most European and many other countries around the world. It is dual SIM and, best of all, although it shipped with Android Lollipop 5.1 it immediately updated to Marshmallow 6.0 as soon as I had the phone setup and running. Although Android 6.0 may look like a minor tweak of Android 5.x there are several changes in how permissions are granted and how apps install that make it worth upgrading. The phone is classic Samsung in all other respects. The 1.5GB RAM available to the OS gives apps enough room to run smoothly. The camera is great, and the Android camera app has been improved substantially over prior versions. The results from the camera are much better than those from another phone that I had owned that appeared to use exactly the same camera component. Battery life has been very good. Last but not least Samsung and Android have now incorporated themes into Android 6.0 and it's now possible to lose the dreadful pastel colors of the stock OS and choose from many different color layouts and themes. The right phone at the right price. Samsung is selling this one in the sweet spot for me. RECOMMENDED.",5,1

262311,Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,"I am a college student who was in desperate need of a new cell phone after my old one stopped working. Because of that I wanted to buy a phone truly worth the money, and one that would last.For someone who isn't willing to pay for 3G service, but still wants internet, and a modern looking phone, THIS is the perfect cell phone. Phones like this are very hard to come by because most do require data packages (the ones considered smartphones anyway). I can't say how it compares to a smartphone having never owned one, but for someone like me it's perfect.- QWERTY keyboard is well spaced, text messaging capabilities are wonderful- WIFI! Can I stress how important this is? It's probably the best feature of the phone. Wi-Fi is pretty much everywhere nowadays, so why buy a smartphone when you can get a phone with Wi-Fi capabilities for a much lower price, and without having to buy a data plan?I've had it for about 3 weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints. The battery lasts about 3-4 days and that's with a good number of hours using it (mostly texting or listening to music).So if you want to buy something definitely worth the money that not only functions great but LOOKS great, this is the phone for you. Best $120 I ever spent!",5,172
90177,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,"I am a BlackBerry loyalist coming from a Bold 9900 and now 4 months of use on a Passport. I also have a Samsung Note 3, as a toy, but Blackberry has always been my preferred system for the way it files messages into one of my hundreds of exchange folders without a lot of scrolling; plus I trust it, so I'm not going anywhere.A 4 month stint with the Passport reminded me of the value of one handed operation, and the importance of the toolbelt in making one handed operation efficient. It comes down to which is more important, reading or one handed operation, because you cannot have both. In the end, I have come to accept that a phone is first a phone, and one handed ergonomics matter most. For that, a smaller size with well-placed hard buttons is worth trading away non-essential functions that are better performed on a PC anyway. When it's time to end a call, the natural impulse is to press a hard END button that will always be in the same place, not to swipe around for the phone app to find the virtual button. For those of us who are always doing 2 things at once, it helps to have always-on hard buttons right where the thumb is comfortable. The Classic gets back to phone fundamentals, with an OS upgrade.Speed keys are improved. You can now speed message, not just speed dial. Just like speed dial, you can assign the key of your choice to text a specific person, or email a specific person, so that after you long press the designated key you can immediately begin typing the message. Can't do that on the 9900.The Classic is pokey. With greater familiarity the lag has become irritating, especially in the calendar app and when filing and deleting messages. On a few occasions I have accidentally misfiled and deleted messages as the system caught up. The pokiness of the Classic is by far my biggest gripe. The Passport is snappy, so why isn't the Classic? Answer: the processor and RAM are mediocre.For hand comfort, the Classic could be better. It's bigger than the 9900, and the back texture feels like hard plastic with nothing special to help the grip. Ergonomically, nothing beats the 9900 with its smaller size and rubberized concave back where your fingers would cradle the phone. I can see the value in the phone's extra girth, but the back texture should have been kept the same as the 9900.Update: I got out the old 9900 after 9 months on the Classic and wow the 9900 feels incredible. Small, light, super comfortable. I hope when a Classic 2 comes out (if ever) that it will be the same form factor as the 9900 but with OS 10. No doubt about it, OS 10 is a major improvement but the Classic's ergonomics are comparatively lousy.About the calendar: One major improvement to the BlackBerry 10 calendar app, over OS 7, is the ability to view text details with WEEK at a glance. If you pinch out, the view will reset so you can view all hours from 9 to 5 and still be able to see who you're meeting with. The Passport also does week at a glance with details, with 3 more hours vertically and 3 more characters per column than the Classic. This was without question at the top of my wish list and very happy to see it in BB10. However, the calendar app has a few design flaws. One, it does not allow appointment creation or editing with a single click. Once you have clicked a time slot, you have to click into the menu structure even deeper still to edit the time, which is inefficient. Then, the time duration is set by a horizontal slider bar or a drop down box, neither of which is intuitive and you cannot see what else you're bumping up against. Second, when you receive a calendar invitation via email, there seems to be no calendar shortcut to check availability before accepting the invitation (OS 7 could do this), so instead you have to take the long way around and remember the proposed date and time as you search your calendar.Web browsing is very fast to load pages and I would say just as fast as Chrome. It runs scripts and remembers login credentials for the sites you allow which it will prompt for the first time you log in.Ideally the home screen showing active apps could be hidden. The open apps just gets in the way because the apps are not in the same location every time. I prefer to tap the icons which are in a static location. It would be fairly easy to hide the active apps home screen by user option.Bottom line, I like the Classic for software reasons, but I miss the 9900's superior responsiveness and ergonomics. Hope you hear me, Blackberry: RESPONSIVENESS AND ERGONOMICS!",3,114

183842,GreatCall Jitterbug Plus Senior Cell Phone with 1-Touch Operator Access (Silver),GreatCall,"I always have the latest and greatest phone but needed something simple for my 84 year old grandmother. This phone is just what I was looking for and then some. It is very well made, very study and feels like it will hold up for a long time. The displays are very clear and large and most importantly, simple with the minimal amount of text which makes navigating the phone easy. The buttons are have back lighting. There are no extra buttons. On/off, Yes, No, Speaker and up and down arrows. The phone makes it very clear on what you need to do and what buttons to push to navigate the menu, make a call, etc.When you sign up for service, the choices for plans and features have a good variety. They offer quite a variety of services geared toward Seniors but you only pay for what you need or want. There is no contract and you can add or change calling plans with no penalty if you need to. They offer discounts and free minutes on the website if you sign up for automatic billing.Activation is very easy. You can either call or do it on-line. I chose online and during the activation process I was able to create a contact book for her with all the aunties and grand kids numbers. Saved me hours on manual entry. I can still manage her contacts online and upload to her phone remotely. I can also change the order they show up as she navigates the contacts on the phone so she sees the ones she uses most often first.I didn't choose any extra features for her because she is in a skilled nursing facility at this time. When she comes home, I know there are several I plan to add. Many of the features are geared towards seniors still living independently. One I particularly like is the abiliity to setup automated calls on a regular basis. If the phone calls are not answered, they designated contacts will receive notice so they can check up themselves. This service is $4 per month.My grandmother has severe arthritis in her hands with very limited finger mobility. This phone is simple enough for her to use. It was also very simple for me to teach her how to use it. It took less than 10 minutes for her to understand everything. I researched most of the phones geared for seniors before I bought this and I am very happy I choose the Jitterbug Plus. She also loves that it is shiny red.",5,150

276498,"Nokia N82 Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, International 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Silver)",Nokia,"I agree with most of what's been written already here and I'd like to add my 2 cents as I have owned the n95-8GB too and I can tell you categorically, the N82 is a much better phone.Despite of the fact that it doesn't have 3G, I've decided to buy it and the reason is that I don't really need the 3G most of the times. Since it has Wi-Fi I can compensate for extensive downloads and applications. Using the EDGE is of course 'painful' compared to 3G and the only downside is that download and voice calls can't go through simultaneously. No biggy.N95 had a lot of bugs and very annoying lags in the camera when shooting (see my n95 review). Worst was a few seconds (literally) from the moment the shutter was pressed to the moment the picture was taken, processed and have the camera ready for the next one. An absolute no go... Slider is so flimsy on the N95 that I was really afraid the screen part is going to crack and dislocate.The N82's camera is a great improvement on that part. It has a Xenon flash and a much faster response time. I personally prefer the lens slide as a camera activator because it prevents accidental camera mode when in the holster, something I have experienced with the N95 quite a lot.Very useful function (especially for travelers): The modem function works great either via the USB modem driver or the Bluetooth, with download speeds that could put some so-called `broadband' speeds to shame. This is great in places where you have no Wi-Fi or free Wi-Fi for your laptop (like in Airport terminals, etc).The phone also syncs with the PC (outlook) using the same connections (through the USB or via Bluetooth)MicroSD: The N82's spec doesn't state support for HC MicroSD memory, but I took the chance and bought an 8GB one and it works flawlessly...Screen: Auto rotation is somewhat annoying but it can be disabled.Media player: Sometimes it freezes with other applications running to the point when it freezes and restarts the phone. It happens rarely but it does (with the latest FW version). Sound quality is reasonable although on my phone I hear clicks and pops on the over tones which is weird because I only transferred the songs as MP3 without additional compression to MP4 which is available through the Media Manager.A-GPS: Well this is a debatable function and whether useful or not it is up to how much really one needs a GPS. I find it to be a nice toy to have but I don't consider it as a serious GPS. In fact the Nokia maps are not so great for this service. The Voice guidance is free for only 3-days after which the navigation is disabled and when used, it redirects to purchase options which are so ridiculously expensive. I downloaded Google maps for the phone which work much better overall.Battery life: Much better than the N95, though it is not even close to what's in the spec. I don't know why Nokia doesn't think about that. The battery should be at least 1300mAh to give a decent battery life between charges.Overall it's a good phone for the price I paid (I don't see why one would pay more than a $150) for the black one as priced on Amazon, or even more for the N95 which doesn't give you more for the money.",4,1

204876,Inmarsat IsatPhone 2 Satellite Phone with SIM card,Inmarsat,"I actually own 2 of these and a Globalstar phone also. Hands down the Inmarsat Isatphone 2 is a better phone and has better service than Globalstar, even after Globalstar launched its new satellites. I live in Southern CA and the Globalstar service is marginal at best. With the Isatphone 2 you just turn it on at it works, so far 100% of the time. The service plans are also very competitive with Globalstar. The Isatphone 2 phone itself costs more, but it is more solidly made and has more features. For instance, you can't even SEND texts with the Globalstar, but you can with the Isatphone. And the Globalstar can only RECEIVE 32 characters of text max, while I believe the Isatphone can receive 160. The only advantage to the Globalstar is that you get US phone number. But I really bought a satellite phone to be able to call out, not receive calls. And the 2 way texting capability of the Isatphone more than makes up for anything else. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that sometimes when the lighted keypad goes dark, pressing any key doesn't light it up again. There might be a specific key to press to do this though.",4,48

The screen is beautiful. The front facing speakers sound just as good as on the HTC One M9.

I almost sent it back and now... I really wish I had trusted my gut. A month or so after having the phone, the device got even slower. I'd click an app and it wouldn't even register the click until about five seconds after, then the app would take another ten seconds to load and then I'd have to wait an even longer amount of time before I click anything in the app or else it would freeze up. Also, I use the wifi almost all the time and it was rather annoying that whenever the phone went to sleep, it would kick the wifi off. Sometimes the wifi would reconnect after a minute or so of the phone being back on, but the majority of the time I have to go and reconnect the wifi... which is a huge issue because I would not be receiving my texts unless I was actively on the phone at all times. And yes, I had the settings set to keep the wifi on all the time (apparently it doesn't work).Now, about 3 months into having the phone, almost every single app crashes or freezes and I have to power off the phone. Also, the phone will go to black screen and will not respond to anything other than a power off. I've tried doing a factory reset and that accomplished nothing.Do not buy this phone.

It was clearly mentioned on Amazon that its a NEW and UNLOCKED phone with all accessories. Somehow I was able to convince him for the refund and shipped the phone back to the seller's address given by the seller himself.Its been more than three months now and I didnt even get a penny back.

193486,HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Glacial Silver),HTC,"Hello all, This phone is defective - I have had the same problems indicated by other customers. The battery and ability to charge and/or hold a charge are all malfunctioning. The problem did not get to the point of recognizing something was wrong until after 30 days, and thefirst few weeks were fine. Then it just day by day deteriorated and is now barely functional. However, the worst part is the customer service from this company - Newtrends. Even though it is obvious a phone costing close to 300 dollars should last well over a year, and that this one dying after about four weeks means they need to replace or refund immediately, they simply wrote that it was too bad but they are not going to do a darn thing! However, the even worst part is that Amazon denied my claim!!!!!! I have been an excellent customer for many years andit is obvious to any of these Amazonians who check my history that I do not make claims except once in a blue moon andfor always good reason. The denial is the most annoying and unreasonable part of the whole thing, since the failure ofthe phone clearly is within the ""A to Z"" guarantee terms. Arrrggghhh!Here is what I wrote to Amazon: The item I received was damaged, defective, or materially different from the item represented on the product detail page and this defect was not evident until after 30 days. I have filed within the 90 day limit. The defect is not digital, but related to thebattery and charging aspects of the phone. It is completely unacceptable that the claim was denied. I demand further action since this device was sold in a condition that the seller must have known it would fail after 30 days. There are other purchasers on Amazon who are having the EXACT same problemwith this phone, I notice. Also, my customer experience for many years shows that I do not make spuriousclaims, ever. This is a legitimate fault on the part of the seller. Please put me intouch with your supervisor if you cannot resolve this to my satisfaction (i.e. full refund).Your A to Z policy clearly covers this claim. If you do not agree, please explain exactly why, and refer to my statements within your explanation. Thank you.",1,9

I don't know if it just went down hill once Lenovo acquired Motorola from Google or if I just happened to get two phones from the same bad batch. When the first phone started exhibiting ""ghost touch"" a day into using the phone, I contacted Motorola customer support. I asked if there was a firmware or software update to fix the issue. I was told by the agent that the behavior was not typical and to return for replacement. I find no fault with Amazon's replacement policy because they had a new unit sent to me the next day. The new phone started doing the same thing!!! A quick Google search brought up results of others having the same issue with no fix available. The standard answer on Lenovo's support forums is to take the phone to a local repair center.When the phone worked, it was great. Apps were responsive, the fingerprint reader was speedy, and the display was sharp. I really liked using it. However, when the phone started acting up, it would switch screens on its own, open apps on its own, and type on its own. It even called my sister by itself, and I had to explain the wonkiness that just happened. One phone I can justify trying again, but twice in a row, it needs to go back for a refund.",2,1

Sure it has a few glitches and bugs, but have already done two firmware updates and most of these seem to have been ironed out. What piece of technology doesn't have weak points? The only thing that is a little off seems to be the signal strength. I live in a marginal area and it doesn't seem to be as good as previous phones. Call quality is good. In saying that it has improved slightly since the updates. GPS is a little slow acquiring the satellites, but this also is better (not perfect).The one issue everyone seems to worry about is the qwerty keypad. I can assure you that once you get the hang of it, it is simple to use, and it seems that it was designed well. Once you learn the shortcuts it is pretty fast to type on.Battery doesn't last very long - but what do you expect when you are running all the features non-stop and constantly opening it up to play on it - because it is a cool phone.I recommend this phone to anyone.

It did fit in my pocket though), and can be a bit uncomfortable to use when plugged in, but nothing major. I was pretty happy with my purchase.HOWEVERSometime around April I received a notification for a ""Wifi-update"" available. After verifying it was from the BLU company itself my logical impulse was to accept and allow the installation. Big mistake, there was a problem with the update and the system was left unusable, sending me straight into Recovery Mode whenever I turned it on.""No big deal,"" I thought, ""this happens to androids all the time, I just have to re-install the system."" Was I wrong...There are no drivers out there for this thing, or at least working ones. Not being that tech-savvy myself I took it to several phone repairmen who install the system on ""Bricked"" phones for a living, none of them has been able to get into this thing.And so, I'm left with a beautiful piece of unusable hardware.My advice: Get his phone, it's an amazing deal, just DO NOT UPDATE IT!

However, at this price point, I can live with both of those issues. The build quality is excellent, the screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at, the camera and video are great, the battery life is outstanding, and it even comes with two cases and a screen protector. I got the gold color and it's not a gaudy gold color. It's light gold and I personally think it looks very premium. You will truly not be disappointed with this phone.

Much faster than I anticipated and I'm guessing it's because of the 3GBs of RAM and 8core processor. Screen is beautiful and my colleagues thought it was comparable to an iPhone 6s+ due to size and quality. Was worried about it working with ATT but I ran it against a friends iPhone 5s also on ATT and it beat it.Only thing I don't like is the vibrate while typing. I've turned it off I'm settings but it's still vibrating. If someone has a solution to this please let me know.,5,2

157413,BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Blue,BLU,"Great little phone. Got this for teenage son for first phone. Does the job. Is unlocked, used with T-Mobile prepaid. No issues at set up. Does have dual SIM (at least the blue one did). Can use business number on one SIM and personal number on other SIM. Doesn't fit my needs but thought I'd mention it. Battery is nice and long. No decent instructions come with it so just takes time to figure everything out. Can lock the keypad by pressing the top left corner control button and the ""*"" key. However this doesn't prevent the phone from shutting off if the power button is held down. I don't like that fact but it's the only real complaint j have. The radio works well and my son has managed to get music on a mini SD card loaded into the phone so it acts as an MP3. Has a camera, but he and I do not believe you can send or receive photos (at least we haven't been able to). Durable little phone, my son is clumsy and drops things a lot so this one has held up for a month so far with no issue. No internet access on this phone (this was the whole reason we purchased it). Did not feel 13 yr old should have access to the entire world in the palm of hand. Lot of responsibility there and with this generations focus to validate self through social media, waned to keep his focus on his real life accomplishments and face to face interactions with friends. He will go through those motions on his own as all teens push for that freedoms and experience. Be for now, while he is still on the younger side of teenage years, this phone works wonderfully for us. P.S. My son has taken our encouragement to be fun with his ""outdated"" type phone in school and often makes remark as it is his Stone Age phone, enticing humor amongst his peers. He says he doesn't mind it being outdated and even likes that it's a little sturdier than his friends. (Of course he does dream for an iPhone but just thought I'd mention it in case any other parents out there were in the same place I was and worried your child might hate you for an outdated phone. They won't, they know you love them and are thinking in their best interest. It shows.) Hope this review details enough for any type I future buyer.",5,15

276951,Nokia X3 Slider GSM Quad-Band Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.5 MP Camera and 2 GB SD Slot Memory -- U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue),Nokia,"Got this phone today. Right out of the box it appeared impressive, pleasing to eye and touch. Tried to get the back cover off according to the manual's instructions but it was no go. Finally I got my jeweler's screw driver out to try prying around the edges. Fortunately without damage, I've discovered what the manual omitted from their instructions. You have to pry up, gently, the lower back case with a blade or tiny screw driver before pushing down and sliding it out. The bottom part of the cover has two prong like tabs which will prevent you from sliding it until you pry it up first. Having survived this part of the struggle then I proceeded to install the simm card and battery. Looking at the manual again I tried to flip up the simm door and it just fell out. It appears the simm door was already damaged and was just pressed in there hoping to pass for the sale. So I never got past this part and requested a return RMA label from Amazon. The simm door and back cover definitely could use a more robust design. In my humble opinion, while this phone offers lots of pleasing features, Nokia dropped the ball.It's going to be returned via UPS tomorrow for full refund.",2,28

The stock android experience is the best experience in my opinion. I also love the fact that Otterbox makes a case for it.

The sim cards were a breeze to insert, I say this because the last Blu he had, the doors for the sim were a thin metal plate, and would not stay closed. You would have to use a piece of tape to hold the door down, and, the sim would not always lie flush against the prongs.

But.....andt this is a major deal breaking but!This phone runs extremely hot. I mean hot enough to cook your dinner on. It's really a shame as I was trying to convince myself to keep it despite this major flaw. But the reality is if the form doesn't follow function then it is useless as far as I am concerned.I really hope Sony tries to make another iteration of this phone without the Snapdragon 810 processor. The phone is too thin to dissipate the heat generated by this monster processor, and the design of the phone prohibits the effective use of this chip. Apparently a software patch will be out soon, but this will only serve to slow down the processor. At the end of the day, this is a hardware issue.I don't know what else quite frankly I'll be purchasing as I don't think anything comes close to it in terms of aesthetic appeal.On another note, the phone was shipped in an unsealed box.

It's the international version, which calls for a EU sim before it can be used anywhere else. That said, my T-mobile sim, unlocked, worked here in the US. Mercate group offered some solid customer service too. Will likely improve with more widely available in the US - as early adoption leads to lack of online support for issues.The good: 1. s5 features, in a smaller package. 2. Price. 3. Availability well before US version gets here. 4. Very light and feels great in your hands. 5. Delivery and customer service from seller. 6. No US manufacturer bloat-ware!A few nit-picks - 1. came with kit kat 4.2 and not 4.4. 2. LTE support is supposedly there, but doesn't seem to work very well (limited band, most likely in the US) 3. battery life is terrible (cannot make it throughout the day, with minimal use). 4. screen isn't quite as good as the s5 full-size. 5. uses USB 2.0 as opposed to 3.0 on the full-size s5.",4,9

118231,BLU Energy X LTE - 4000 mAh Super Battery - GSM Unlocked - Black,BLU,"good phone. currently using it as a backup. great for low intensity use! unfortunately, I am not a low intensity user. The device only has 1gb of ram which causes the phone to pause for 5 seconds at a time when surfing. probably due to all those automated predictions the browser or google is doing. Sometimes apps don't feel like they start up fast enough. Touches dont register too well. yeah, I know I can clear the apps in the background, but doing that every time i want dcent perfornance... No thanks.Aside from that, if you bought this phone ONLY for battery life then you've come to the right place! Even after long 16 hour day I still had 60% left. I had an zenfone 2 which would be around 10% after the usage I put this thing through. My use largely consists of YouTube videos and music using the WiFi and a Bluetooth headset, podcasts and some web surfing. 4 - 6 hours usage after a day with power left over.4G, wifi and phone antennas all work just fine. bars are consistenly on the high side.Poor performance from bluetooth.The Bluetooth connection skips on a regular basis with ALL types of audio. Downloaded music, podcasts, streaming. Additionally, when watching YouTube videos you can see the audio is not in sync and audio stutters every few seconds. Its not the headset, because I tried it with some Bluetooth speakers and I heard the distinct skips/stutters there too. BT speakers tend to hide skips better but theyre still there. (update 6/3/16)No skips when using a 3.5mm male/male cable to speakers or wired headphones.before I forget....it comes packaged with a USB cable, some paperwork, a plastic screen protector and a hard plastic case. you'll need the latter as the phone is slippery as glass. feels hefty and quite solid in hand(non-removable 4000mah battery).",1,1

Now don't compare it to a Samsung GS5 or 6, because you are comparing a $250 phone with a ~$700 phone. I would make sure to get a case for this phone as the plastic around the front screen is not as hardened as some other phones I have had that were plastic as well and have some dings already. The OS that is loaded on this is ok and I would be willing to look over so much if they made the OS a little better and the pre-loaded bloatware can get in the way at times. For people on a budget that doesn't want a cheap less than $100 phone, I would recommend this phone. Now, between the Laser model and non-Laser model, is that if you are not too concerned on the better camera, the non-laser model has NFC, which I wished it would have kept. As this is where you can really implement Google pay with your device and share files and such easier with that feature. So weigh the options between the two before getting the phone. TO ASUS: Please improve on the OS that is loaded on and don't bog down people with stuff that you think will be beneficial. We want more freedom with the phone!",4,1

Having the convenience of a smart phone on my wrist without having to carry or unholster a cell phone is excellent! Especially when walking my dog or listening to music on the treadmill. It's a fascinating watch that is a great ""showpiece"" in public venues...I've sent the amazon link to many inquiring minds that want a wristwatch! Callers can hear me pretty well, though I sometimes strain to hear their responses in public venues.Not so good news: The phone won't connect to my bluetooth earpiece which would improve my ability to hear folks on the phone without holding my wrist to my ear. Occasionally I get feedback (reverb?) in the background. I also have issues connecting to the internet (uses WAP). Less than a month after purchase, my earbud isn't connecting properly; so, I can no longer utilize the FM radio (ear piece must be connected) and replacement parts aren't available on Amazon.

11388,Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Locked to Sprint,Apple,"From a long time Droid user, I can say that I have overcome my fear of the iPhone and now prefer it over other phones. I used to be a diabolical hater of this phone, along with my friends Craig, Rob, and Stephen. Who would have thought they would hate Apple stuff?? I thought all liberals yearned for the day they could lick the sweat from Steve Jobs sack (metaphorically speaking of course). Anyway I broke away from the thought process that had been embedded in my mind since my childhood about iPhones and decided to try them out. Much to my surprise, they are pretty cool. Maybe one day the other guys will come around, if I can ever get them to give up on this human centipede thing they've been trying to do with each other.Overall review: 5 stars. I'd buy again.",5,1

276976,Nokia X3 Slider GSM Quad-Band Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.5 MP Camera and 2 GB SD Slot Memory -- U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue),Nokia,"For those who don't want to renew your contract, this is a wonderful unlocked GSM phone with quite a lot of feature at a very reasonable price.Before I get started, there is one point to keep in mind. This is an unlocked phone. There is some configuring that has to be done in order to get internet and MMS working with your provider. Nokia used to have a site that would send carrier specific info to the phone, but I believe they have taken it down. You may have to search forums and/or call your carrier customer support for this one. Call and SMS will work ""out of box"", but anything internet dependent will require some fiddling.On to the review.I have found for a $140 phone, this pretty much does everything I'd want a basic cell phone to do, almost to the point where I don't really care about have a higher end smart phone.Call quality is great and I have found that the Series 40 UI far easier to use than most of the carrier locked phones we have in the UI. If you're using an ATT or TMO Nokia phone, you are not experiencing the full potential that Nokia has to offer.Nokia's email client is great for basic email checking and even without 3G data capabilities, I found EDGE data speeds more than sufficient. With T9 predictive entry, even sending basic reply messages is relatively quick.The media player keys are a handy touch, and the FM radio is also a nice additional feature. Overall, I found Nokia's generic media player much more pleasant than that of most other low end phones.Onto some cons...I have accidentally hung up on some calls as the screen tends to stick to my face and if I keep moving my hand, I will eventually slide the phone far enough to cause the call to end.There is no feature to auto-lock the keys when the slider is closed. You either have to select the ""Lock"" option immediately after closing the slide or enable the auto keyguard feature to lock after a set amount of time. This is kind of a vestige of Nokia's candy bar only phone days.No Nokia Maps. Even though this phone has no GPS, it's nice to still look up maps when you're in a bind. I've used several other S40 phones with this feature(with and without GPS) and although it's no Google Maps or Nokia Navigation, for such an inexpensive phone, it's good enough.Overall, for the price, you will get a lot. If you're looking for a basic unlocked phone sans contract, this is the phone for you. You may even be pleasantly surprised.",4,46

Looking to buy a second for a backup since I tend to be rough on phones. If any suggestions, I wish the QWERTY was more like the Neon II. I really like my wife's old one.

Never again will I spend that kind of money because I bought this used (Amazon Warehouse - ""very good"") for $138 and it was immaculate in its original packaging with no wear whatsoever.This phone has the latest Android update and is very ""speedy"" with no stutter or freezing when swiping rapidly between apps and screens. Some say the camera is lacking but I see no drop in quality from what I was used to and I really like the simplicity of the camera interface using only one hand. The size is also just right for my big hands and slides easily into my shirt or pants/shorts pockets.

I am not a real whiz bang person, I use my phone for actual phone calls, and for texting, so the graphics / technical stuff is fine for me, where it may or may not be for someone else. It does what I need it to do so in that respect it is a great bang for the buck. HOWEVER, my one gripe is the volume, this is my 3rd Blu phone and it seems like with each model the ring and talk volume has gotten quieter. When I put this one in particular on speaker phone I still have to hold it close to my ear to hear, it is ridiculous!!! For those of you who see me as old school, because I don't use my phone for much more than making phone calls and therefore think I am old and hard of hearing and that is the problem... Even my 20 year old son, made comment on how annoyingly quite the call volume is. I don't get it... I mean I know it is no Samsung Galaxy, and is very reasonably priced.

Downside - it's not a Lumina so the version of Windows is slightly crippled. Loading contacts is a pain.While the 512MB of RAM limits gaming apps that can be loaded, most apps work fine.

These being a relatively short battery life, at times operating at frighteningly High Temperatures, and most annoying of all...an apparent complete lack of ability to connect wirelessly to satellite devices via Blue Tooth. While for the first two limitations I have established satisfactory work arounds via the internet. Unfortunately, none of the proposed potential ""fixes"" I have researched and implimented from the online community thus far has resolved the ""failure to communicate"" via Blue Tooth challenge. While for me, not a show stopper, as regardless I plan to keep the phone, I suspect for many it would be, as it is very annoying to need to use wired head phones with a phone supposedly Blue Tooth capable...also, while I never use my phone while driving for listening to music or hands free purposes, and therefore this capability loss is not an issue...expect others would think differently/not be so forgiving in this regard.",4,8

There are a lot of settings and options that can be adjusted before/during/after taking photos so that you always get a good shot. In comparison to the iPhone, it is a little grainy, but definitely takes nice photos. The front camera is actually really good - great news for all you selfie takers.The processor seems to do a good job with keeping up; even when there are multiple apps open and running, this thing does not seem to lock up or lag. Having 1GB RAM is great, the 8GB built in memory ends up being about 5GB remaining after the OS takes its chunk, but with 5GB and the option to put a micro SD in for back up, there is a lot of available space for apps/games/pics.The size is very nice. The phone is big - 5"" screen makes viewing webpages/etc. very easy - but is surprisingly thin and light. I have never been a fan of really big phones, but this one does not seem to be too massive. Fits nicely in my hand for making calls, and is a great size for browsing web or using apps.Brought the phone up to 100% charge in the morning, and have since been making calls, downloading all of my favorite apps, checkin out existing apps and taking photos and videos to see how well they work. For all that I have been doing, cannot believe that there is still 64% battery life over 24hrs later.As far as calling goes; I have noticed, like some reviews, that people seem to notice a difference in the sound when I'm talking. Not that they can't hear/understand me - seems the tone of my voice is different, and it seems like there is some kind of echo or interference at times. I wonder if this is a problem with the internal mic, as sound in videos seems to be very loud and sometimes distorted.Overall, for someone that does a lot of texting and browsing the web, this phone is very nice. For all of the options, included apps, OS, and usability you really cannot beat this price for an unlocked phone.",4,1
4831,"Apple iPhone 3G Black, 16GB",,"For a purchase from the Buying CompanyGood points:- The product matched the description, Black iPhone 3Gs 16gb, unlocked, with earphones, power adapter and USB cable.- Good price,- It was nice of the seller to throw in a charger adapter, a USB cable, and new earphones (although not apple earphones but copies, without the answer button).Bad points and reasons for 3 stars only:- Most importantly, the ""expedited 1-3 day"" shipping is sort of a joke. I received my iPhone 7 days after ordering it (including a weekend). It was sent by road and feels like it is not worth more than the cheaper regular shipping. ""1-3 day"" sounds like a lie, expecially since the box said ""UPS 3-day shipping"", so no chance to blessed with a 1-day delivery. The reason I am picky on this is because I bought this to recover from a broken phone and was without a phone during the time of delivery, making me very impatient when (1) the phone was not sent on a Saturday when I ordered on a Friday, and (2) I could track the phone slowly making its way from Dallas TX to Washington DC), from Monday to Thursday.- The iPhone was supposed to be ""used-very good"" but it had some features that didn't quite match that standard. Most importantly, the mute button on the iPhone, known to get defective after some time was already broken when I received the phone. Other than that, the phone looks goods with very few scratches (the back side of the power entry, another recurrent defect, is not crack, which is good).- The iPhone was not restored when I received it. It had the Cydia app on it, meaning it is jailbroken, which is not something I expected, nor something I think a sold iPhone should have (although legal now).",3,2

It does more and has more features than any non-smart phone I have come across, yet it debuted in 2007. The only things I don't like about the phone are the specialized plugs necessary for charging and listening to the radio (no chargers available at gas station convenience stores), and it's limited to only one recurring alarm. If people insist upon texting to you, it's possible to speak for almost 6 1/2 minutes, and send that as your reply, and that is easy-peasy. Until I ABSOLUTELY have to get a smartphone, this little baby is my phone of choice. It's the ""pocket rocket"" of dumb phones. Sony Ericsson hit this one out of the park before affordable smart phones came on the scene. I save $20/mo. (minimium) by hanging on to this little phone (and I do mean little--a friend has the new Samsung Galaxy 5, and it's hot, too big to hold comfortably, and is quite delicate compared to my Sony Ericsson). Yeah, the camera is only 2 MP, but when it came out and could do video as well as still photos, that was darn good for its time.

(btw: no bluetooth when listening to FM) Battery life seems good for this casual user, but charges fast with included charger or with wireless Qi.

Look of phone is phine, who cares. when it gets sheathed in rubber and it's never going to be as elegant as the s4 Active anyway. I think it is OTG, but will see when micro adapter gets here.

The display screen came off at the time and the body of the cell phone was all scratched up. When I contacted DataVision and complained (they make you hold like 20 minutes before you are able to speak to any representative), they apologised and basically told me to buy a new one and the best they could do was to send it for free while sending the previous one back. I had to gift this one to a family member just before christmass and therefore I had no option but to go ahead with their offer. However the return postage on the return item was paid by me and I have not been reimbursed the money yet for the return item even after nearly a month has passed. I will not buy anything from Datavision from now on.",1,5

343305,Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 16GB LTE Unlocked International Version White,Samsung,"First phone that i buy on Amazon and its a really good phone. No complains about it at all except for the charger and the US adapter. Bought another original charger and now all that is fixed, the device runs smooth and i can multi-task really well with it. I have had it for 17 days now and i haven't got tired of it, most likely i never will. It does require alot of care if your always pulling the phone out of your pocket to check for messages or any notifications, i dropped it once and it landed on rocks and shattered the glass but luckily it was the Glass tR Slim screen protector that saved it. Not a big deal because it can always be replaced for $30 instead of paying a whole lot more for fixing shattered glass from the device.",5,1

Then the flash on this phone did not work, probably caused it's a used phone and the feature might have been broken. Returned this phone and got one from a different store.",3,1
290595,"Pantech Pocket P9060 Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 2.3 OS, Touchscreen, 5MP Camera, Video, GPS, Wi-Fi, SNS integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - Gray",,"First off, I ordered this ""new"" phone and it was certainly used when i got it, scratched screen and scuffed bottom. I can't remember the seller, as the the seller for which Amazon is filling orders has changed a couple times. I obtained an rma the day I got it...But I liked the phone and wanted to give it another try, so I ordered another hoping that it would indeed be new, and it was. The microsd card was taken out, which was a little annoying, but it forced me to buy an 8 gig. I really like the form factor of the phone, very nice build and screen, but as mentioned by others, Pantech did cheap out a little. Onboard storage and ram are very low, which causes issues with apps and I believe most of the problems people have with calls and screen lock up. I don't have a lot of apps, and keep them ""killed"" so I haven't had any issues so far, and call quality is great.So, if your looking for a top of the line android, with top of the line specs, the Pocket probably isn't for you. But if you want a nice large screen, and aren't app heavy, with added 4g via HSPA+, then i'd recommend it.Another note, I use this with Straight Talk, and after changing the ANPs, very easy with Android, it works greatUpdate - 10/28/14Well, its been two years and I'm updating my review... And sorry to those that asked questions, I didn't know about that function and my ability to track those comments and questions, but I am now.So, I used this phone for over a year on Straight Talk and then moved on to another phone/service, and put this in my phone drawer. Well not to much later my wife dropped her phone and broke the screen, so we pulled this phone out and popped in an Airvoice Wireless Sim, on their $30 a month unlimited plan, and it worked great. She used it for a while with no issues, though she did complain about its speed, or lack there of. Lots of bloatware and 512mb on Gingerbread 2.3 don't go well together.And last month we moved service again, we're now on Cricket Wireless as they are owned by ATT. But this time I dropped my phone, poor Nokia Lumia, and broke the screen. So once again I pulled the trusty Pocket out of my phone drawer and tossed in the Cricket Sim, no APN changes as its all ATT now, and I was off and running. But having used much faster phones I was getting really frustrated with the pockey pocket, so I rooted it and removed all of the ATT bloatware, and some stuff I will never need, and followed the advice from another reviewer and downloaded Smart Booster and set it to ""boost"" every 5 minutes, and its much better.And another awesome thing I found out, is that the Tethering & Portable Hotspot option is fully functional. Had to use it while internet was down at my parents. That was a great find, and I'll probably pass it along to my mother to use just because the hotspot function works.So, after 2 years the Pocket works just as it did when I got it, and I'm finding out new things about it. As you can see, we are hard on phones, and the Pocket has barely any signs of use with just a cheap tpu cover and screen protector.Pantech had a good idea with the Pocket, they should have gone all the way with it. And Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, or newer, would make it even better...",4,30
245995,"Motorola Droid 2 A955 Verizon Phone 5MP Cam, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth",Motorola,First off the company I got this phone from is A+! They answered all my emails with all my questions on this phone.

It's easy to navigate and I found the online manual easily if I needed any help on working it. It stays charged well and is a durable phone.,5,2
262138,Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,"First off I love the phone after I got everything figured out. Basically all I had to do was pop my sim card out of my existing (AT&T Customer) phone and I was good to go, sort of! lol From that point I could call my contacts, send text messages, and even connect to the internet via wifi. Now the problems I discovered shortly there after was it connected to the wifi but could not go to any webpages because it would time out. It would not even go to the nokia pre-loaded store icon on the phone. Well, I could tell that there was settings not configured somewhere because it is unlocked for different carriers and needed at&t settings entered. Another problem I encountered was I could send text and recieve them just fine but could not recieve or send pictures with text messages succesfully. That was aggrevating because I could do that with my old phone just fine, but not this one. I found the solutions to fix these problems on-line after searching for awhile. So if you want these problems fixed here they are:MMSMenu > Settings > Configuration > Personal Settings > Options > Add New > Multimedia MsgAccount Name: AT&T MMSServer address: [...]Use pref. Access pt: NoAccess point settings- Proxy: enabled- Proxy address: [...]- Proxy port: 80Bearer settings- Packet data acc. pt: wap.cingular- Network type: IPv4- Authentication type: Normal- User name: [...] (all capital letters)- Password: CINGULAR1 (all capital letters)Now go back to the Personal Settings (Personal accounts) > Options > ActivateInternetMenu > Settings > Configuration > Personal Settings > Options > Add New > WebAccount Name: Media NetHomepage: [...]User name: leave blankPassword: leave blankUse pref.

Just thought I would pass this info along because you will encounter these problems with at&t as your carrier. Overall I would definitely buy the phone again because it is Nokia quality and thats hard to beat in my opinion!!",4,85

276610,Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black),Nokia,"First of all, the hardware is gorgeous. It's the best looking phone I've ever seen, really. The beveled glass is stunning, it's so sleek and minimalistic.The guts are just a little last generation. Just a little. Single core, which does pretty good all things considered. The back camera is pretty good, but not great. The front camera is exactly what you'd expect from a camera. The headset speaker is awful, and the conference speaker is just ok. From what people tell me, the mic is pretty good though, and it filters out a good bit of background noise. The 64g storage is great.Meego OS is absolutely awesome. I love the OS itself. Innovative, smooth, lots of fun and easy to use. The settings grouped a little odd, but you get used to it. The built-in music app is really good (and plays FLAC out of the box!), the built-in video player is awful. The built-in video player is really picky, and won't play a lot of usual videos (mostly screen resolution issues, I think).Now, the real drawback - the apps. Not much out there. There are some apps, and a handful of those are really good. Most of the good ones are paid-only, and more likely than not it's going to be more than .99 cents. I'm fine with that (I'll gladly pay for a good app), but coming from Android or iOS people are going to be surprised.I found enough apps to cover everything I absolutely needed, so I'm good. App addicts are not going to like it, for sure. Social media is relatively well covered here. Skype has chat and calls, but no video calls (real bummer). It had Google's Video Chat, until Google changed the API to try to force people into signing up for their social media site. Sigh. Now Google Video Chat sort of works, sometimes, and usually only when someone calls you with it. The biggest bummer for my purposes is the lack of a really good podcatching app. There are three in the store - 2 don't work and one works... Mostly... But it's missing a lot of the niceties that even an app on my Blackberry 8320 had 7 years ago.All in all, I absolutely love this phone and I am not sorry I bought it. I plan on using it until it dies. It's such a breath of fresh air from the other two platforms. But, because it's a dead OS, it most certainly isn't going to be for everyone.",4,1
150365,BLU Studio C Super Camera -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM- Green,BLU,"First of all, I hate when there are a bunch of great reviews from people who received the phone for free to give a review. I wish Amazon would NOT allow this.As for the phone - I want to start by saying that I don't need a super charged ultra special high functionality smartphone. I HAD a Samsung Galaxy S4 and didn't think it was worth the money since I don't really stream things and I just use it for calls, texting, pictures, and emails.I'm not a techie, but I'm also not naïve about technology. I knew I was getting a subpar phone for $100.The Good:1) The camera is really amazing. It put the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S4 to shame. Especially the front facing camera. I LOVED the quality of these pictures. FANTASTIC! Beautiful, clear, detailed, high quality pictures for a $100 phone. I spent $500 on my Galaxy S4 and it paled in comparison.2) The size and weight of the phone was perfect. Very light, very thin, and fir very well in my hand. I have shorter fingers and have a hard time with phones that are too wide. This phone was PERFECT for my hands.3) Love the color options. I ordered Pink and it was super cute.4) Speed was fine, not issues at all for what I was doing. Lots of the features that the S4 had.5) Dual Sim card slots is a great option.The Bad:1) States that you can use up to a 32 GB micro SD card, and I put mine in. However the phone couldn't read ANY of my files from the card. I couldn't listen to my music, pull up my ring tones, or see my photos. I searched and searched the BLU website/support, online, and the manual on the phone that links to their website and there was no troubleshooting help listed. I tried downloading different apps that might allow me to see the files and nothing. I don't know if it was a defective phone, or if the phone just doesn't read certain types of files, but if that is the case, this needs to be laid our VERY specifically for people when they are purchasing. This was a deal breaker for me.2) When I would talk on the phone via the handset, attach the wired headset that comes with the phone, AND use the Bluetooth headset that I have used for a while, my calls all appeared to be clear and sound great, but the people I was talking to said that I continued to intermittently fade out and sound ""blurry"". This is without moving around and in the same service area as I have been in before with no issues and have not had issues since I stopped using the phone. So must be the phone.3) when talking on the handset, the screen goes crazy. It doesn't black out. You have to physically turn it off otherwise your call might be placed on hold, hung up on, or random apps might open. This hasn't happened to me with other phones, so it's not like I'm a phone idiot.I really had high hopes for this phone as my low cost, low expectation phone. And the Good ALMOST outweighed the bad. Almost. I am returning the phone because of the issues with quality of calls and the SD card issues. Too bad, because it otherwise seemed like the perfect phone for me.",3,38
241850,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked,,"First of all, I am picky about phones, tablets...all electronics. Being a techie type, I researched many phones before I decided to purchase this G4 Play...And after using this phone every day, all day long, I have discovered that this was the best choice of a phone for me.Well, I have written my review as if I were you reading reviews trying to decide to buy this phone or not...PROS:+ MICRO SIM CARD -- While Nano Sims are gradually being the standard SIM size and are the size for newer phones, I still like this size.Note to Nano SIM users: You can install a Nano SIM in this phone IF you carefully place it into an adapter or just go to your phone store and they can move your info from your Nano Card to a new Micro SIM card. Be sure you have a new Micro SIM with you in case they do not have one. Amazon sells Micro Sims.+ Size, Weight, and Comfort of the Phone...This 5 inch screen, weight of the phone, comfort while holding this phone are some major reasons why I bought this phone. I had a huge 5.5 Samsung J7 (2015). It was too big for my small hands and very uncomfortable to hold. And because the G4 Play is a lighter weight phone and not bulky, I am love this!This phone fits my hand perfectly and comfortable to hold.+ Memory/Storage has 16GB Internal however after OS and factory apps 10.6 GB left. External card slot can handle up to 256GB.There is no bloatware...pure Android experience...About twenty one essential factory Installed apps including Phone and Help. Most of the apps are Android / Google Apps. Only about six Motorola apps which includes the Camera, File Manager, FM Radio, Phone, Settings and Calc. Motorola allows Android and Google to supply just the Apps you need, however, later on you can install Apps you like as there is plenty of room left. Below is a list of Google / Android Apps pre-installed on this phone:* Calendar (Google Calendar)* Clock (Google Clock)* Contacts (Google)* Chrome Internet Browser* FM Radio App (Moto installed this on this phone, no Internet needed...real FM Radio)* Google App* Google Maps* Google Music* Hangouts (Google)* Messenger (Google Messenger for Texts and MMS (Picture or Video Messages).* Photos (It is a Photo Gallery by Google).* Play Movies/Play Music* Playstore* Settings (Android Settings)Because I just installed Apps I wanted like Facebook, Twitter, PrinterShare and other large Apps, I still have 8.25 GB Internal Storage now left if I want to add more apps later on.+ Memory & Storage Size & Speed ... The Internal Memory and RAM are adequate and I find the phone runs plenty fast and for me, no lagging, never freezes. A very peppy phone in my opinion.+ Marshmallows 6.01 installed and promises to later update to Nougat 7 OS when available. This I am very happy about because my Samsung J7 M model has yet to update to Marshmallow it still has Lollipop. Other J7 models should get it but I am not sure J7 M model my old one ever will.+ Camera...It is just 8MP however, I took inside and outside pictures and they came out very clear in my opinion. This is much to my happy surprise.+ Screen Resolution/Special Screen Information - For me personally, I find the resolution (at 294 PPI - Pixels Per Inch) excellent as the colors in the screen are very bright and vivid and very clear! In fact, webpages and my Kindle Reading app are just stunning on this phone! *All of my pictures and videos are crystal clear with this phone.***OUTSIDE VIEWING in Direct Sunlight with this screen... OK if I turn the screen slightly to the right because the Brightness NITS are about 400 Nits so this is good (adequate). Some more expensive phones have at least 500 Nits...some have close to 700 Nits of brightness. The higher the Brightness Nits the easier it is to see your screen in bright sunlight. * There is no way to increase the Nits on this phone but I could view it somewhat in direct sunlight.+ WiFi and 4G (LTE) (Internet)Info:WiFi Connects to any WiFi and the signal strength is excellent (even in the very back of my home and outside), most of the time I have 4 bars (outside is 3 bars).LTE (Data) When not near a router or WiFi hotspot, then I use LTE (Data) for Internet. The LTE on this phone is LIGHTENING FAST when I use data.* Note: At home, I use WiFi on my secured Router with a password. However, when I travel I use LTE Data on this phone as it is much more secure tha a Open WiFi Hot spot at say a cafe etc. This way, I know I feel more secure on the Internet.+ OTG – This phone supports On the Go with the micro USB port so I can add a 256 GB flash drive with my office files, pictures etc and the phone easily reads these files.+ Temperature of the battery and coolness of this phone - This phone and battery runs very cool with the Snapdragon 410 processor (the 600 & higher Snapdragon processors on other devices can run hot). With this phone's 410 cool processor the normal temp and most of the time it is running at 78 F degrees to 87 F degrees. When I download lots of apps or play games, it may get up to 90 degrees for a couple of minutes but goes right down to normal temps. I have run many programs on this phone and it DOES NOT OVERHEAT. I have read that some newer smart phones will sometimes get up as high as 112 degrees, this one for me has not done this.It is important to keep a phone running cooler as it will prolong the life of the phone and it is easier on the battery as well.+ Phone call Clarity/Loudness etc. - Loud enough speaker and sound is very clear, best phone I used..No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset or speaker.The front speaker on this phone is plenty loud...better than my Samsung J7 was!+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the very good battery life. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness, if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off, I get close to all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning). Also to save battery, I turn off WiFi or Data and tap the ON OFF button (put to sleep). This way, I use my phone into the night on a single charge.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 256GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone! (I placed a 64GB SD Card in this phone and I still have room left).*Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ G4 Play Prints pictures and documents! I print pictures, PDF documents, Documents and more right from this phone! I have an HP Envy 4500 Wireless Printer...then I installed PrinterShare from the Playstore...I paid 10 dollars for the Premium version as the free one did not work as well. If you need more info regarding the Printing on Moto G4 Play, please ask me in comment section.+ Music Player..The installed player is Google Play Player, however, I did not like it as it used too much battery/memory so I went to Playstore and installed the free Rocket Player...this uses very little battery and memory and has lots of themes, easy to make Playlist, etc.+ MS Office...I installed free from Playstore WJS OFFICE as I need use this 100 percent compatible MS Office compatible on the road. Works great for me. I highly recommend this free Office app.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this phone: I downloaded a FREE APP called WPS Office (free) which I use for Office files (it reads, edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc, my docs are crisp and clear using this app.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+ Watching Videos online...I use an app called Internet free from Playstore and also Chrome and I watch online videos by pressing the big white arrow in center of video. I have watched all the videos I wanted on several browsers just fine.For Amazon videos there is an Amazon Video app that I discovered that I use on my Android tablet to watch my Amazon videos.CONS:- Just a couple of minor Cons I found...The phone I received did not come with a headset...no problem as I already have a headset that works on this phone. (I prefer a Bluetooth headset because the sound quality us so much better). Amazon offers many plug in or Bluetooth headsets ar low prices.Also, the charger that came with the phone is a slower charger, however, I have a 2 amp charger that I use and it charges this phone quickly.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes in a heartbeat as the size is perfect for me. And for the money, I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes, for two reasons.:1) Yes if you want a very easy to use phone.2) Yes if you have small hands and small fingers as the keyboard is small.If you have large hands and large fingers, this phone may be too small for you...so you should then consider a 5.5 inch or higher screen phone.***This phone I recommend to a person wants a smaller, comfortable to hold phone and also a very easy to use phone. ** Personally, I love this phone because it is fits my hands perfectly, easy to use, fun to use and it is a beautiful phone!Thank you for reading this review. I tested the phone thoroughly before I wrote this review. If you have questions about this phone please ask me in the comment section as I am a techie type and will answer right away.",5,366

I thoroughly enjoy the built in stamina battery function. I use to carry my external battery everywhere and now it is collecting dust. The Z3 is also pretty responsive to every action i do. Opening games, apps, taking pictures, and playing music are smooth and pretty instantaneous. The duel speakers are loud enough, clear and crisp. OMG the pictures it can take look so clean and are beautiful. The screen really brings out the colors in almost everything displayed.Now, minor issues that i feel may be a problem is the flaps you remove to charge (via USB). At first it was weird to remove and when it is charging i fear the flap will rip off. But they have an alternate way to charge without the hassle. The only thing is that you have to get Sony's magnetic charger. Which is pretty lame that the magnetic end doesn't come with the phone.Either way i feel this product deserves its five stars. I've had this phone for over a month and so far everything as met my exceptions and more.",5,1

302424,RIM Blackberry 8700g Bluetooth Unlocked GSM QWERTY Smartphone,RIM,"First and foremost, AT&T is my carrier and I don't particularly care for them (but that is a completely different story). I bought this phone because the free phone that AT&T gave me had almost no signal everywhere that I went (including my house) and the battery life depleted very quickly. So I was just looking for a cheap replacement until my contract is up and I can switch carriers. This phone does exactly what I want it to do and NOTHING more (no camera, no micro SD slot, nothing fancy). I don't have a data plan currently so I can't say anything about browsing the web. But this phone does have a very consistently strong signal and now I don't drop anymore phone calls. This phone is fairly easy to text with but, the buttons feel kind of cheap and there are a lot of sub menus ( and I do mean very many sub menus). So all in all, it was a solid purchase and I feel like I got my money's worth. Not the most convenient phone ever but a good backup to keep around in case I drop a better phone into a puddle or something.",3,5
255474,Motorola RAZR V3 Black (AT&T),Motorola,"First and foremost what I look for in a cell phone is functionality. In that I mean its abilities to make and recieve calls.I've read that this Razr recieved the most sophisticated antenna ever put into a Moto phone. I believe that hands down. I rarely lose a signal and calls sound near perfect most of the time.The camera is good, not great, but good. Much, much better than my old Sanyo SCP-8100 (Sprint). The digital zoom works flawlessly and leaves no pixelation when zoomed (a common problem with dig. zooms) very clear. A friends Sanyo SCH-a670 leaves great pixelation when zoomed. Better software in the Moto I assume.Speaking of software I highly recommend the Moto Phone Tools 3.0! I bought this with my Razr because I knew I wanted to pimp my phone to the max. It works awesome! All those MP3 ringtones I use to Download for $3 a pop - gone. I make my own wallpapers and MP3 ringtones now. For free. Plus when you plug the phone to your USB port on your PC it also acts as a charger! Charging the battery as you load media onto your cell.The bluetooth works flawlessly as well. I bought the Motorola HS850 headset. The calls are crystal clear. You could answer and make calls while never opening your phone. The voice dialing works superbly on the Razr.This is a quad (4) band GSM world phone. You could go to Japan and use this thing.*EDIT* this phone STILL works awesomely. It has been handed down to another family member and then rehanded down to another family member. It continues to be a true Die-Hard! Like the Toyota of cell's - but without the sticky throttle thing. :PThis Razr could also be used as a modem to connect you laptop or desktop to the internet. Anywhere theres a GSM signal. A nice feature I thought. Especially for gadget freaks.The internal color screen is the best I've ever seen on a phone to this date. No kidding. Bright and vibrant. Some of my wallpapers seem to be 3-D.The phone is very thin and light. When opened it fits naturally to your face. Just the right size. Earpiece to ear, mouthpiece to mouth.Pro'sClear calls, great antenna.Good cameraWorld phoneCan store 1000+ phone numbersCan be used as a PC modemAwesome internal color screenBattery lifeBlutoothVery thin and lightVoice dialingMany customizable featuresConsNo expandable media slotNo video capability (Cingular) without hacking the phoneNo dedicated media buttons.All in all I'm thrilled with the phone. Next year Motorola is releasing a Razr V3x. 2 MP camera (external), video calls (with a seperate inner-hinge video cam, expandable media slot, List price @ $900. You should probably expect deals for $400 - $500 in the stores.",5,197
248886,Motorola KRZR K1 T-Mobile Camera Phone,Motorola,"First and foremost this is a Style and Media phone. Silver is far more luxe than tired black and it synchs w/ this shiny glass front much better. T-Mobile's silver KRZR k1 is glam. The sound of the media player is peerless (to my knowledge). The sizable micro mini memory card holds plenty of media, and this is a good thing for a phone which records up to 3+ minute movies at a time. What's more, you may even arrange playlists to suit your mood & the battery life seems much better than one might expect w/ such a bright screen to boot. However, I might dim it a few notches for optimal battery life. It will still be plenty bright.The camera is quite noteworthy. More adjustments than I can get into, just know that you need to adjust both camera and video to take best quality photos. They are not the default settings. You might also note that, any time you zoom a pic or vid, you are greatly reducing its clarity. Other than that, adjust your images to 2 megapixels and your photos will be quite large and quite clear. I'm one of those w/whom the difference between HDTV and a good TV is almost unrecognizable. I like a nice, crisp photos... I don't study them. GREAT camera... great video.Music, videos and photos may be downloaded via bluetooth or a USB cable which is provided.Now on to the Net. This is where the rubber meets the road for me as I don't really use portable music players. Right off the bat, I downloaded Opera's Mini Browser. It's far more robust than the factory installed. I was able to go to Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo mail and many other sites as well. The KRZR also comes loaded w/ Y! Messenger & AIM. Good stuff. This phone does NOT have an email client.I'm a smartphone owner (Nokia 6600), so I'm used to an email client for a couple of accounts and being able to use Opera Mobile which allows one to attach files and send messages, open multiple windows, store passwords and bookmarks, download mp3s as well as access nearly any website. Unfortunately, sick American corporations have determined that since we will pay an extra $20-30/month for PDA service (basically the same phone w/ a QWERTY keyboard), why offer more affordable smarthphones. THANKS TO AMAZON you may still purchase smartphones, but usually w/o the discount attached to a service plan.As for reception, this has as much to do w/ locale as phone and service operator. T-Mobile is a GSM carrier which means you may use your phone all over the globe. It also means you may text overseas & you have a SIM card to transport your phone book and account easily to any other GSM phone you may have or purchase. If you purchase an unlocked GSM phone in Timbuktu, you may insert your card and go. Not so w/ Sprint & Verizon. Ya gotta go through daddy. At one time TDMA/CDMA services (Sprint & Verizon) had better tracking, but GSM (T-Mobile & AT&T) has caught up. T-Mobile has excellent reception and tracking... at least in the places I've been to & my phone worked in Europe w/ ease.I always thought of Motorolas as cheap and the RAZR as gimmicky. Moto's interface is a bit dated and could be a tad more intuitive, but the KRZR seems to be of good quality so far.As for Wirefly, well, I'm no fan of the company. One worker had the nerve to ask for my credit card info. Nice try, but I don't use my credit card twice for the same purchase. What the fffff.....!Overall, The KRZR K1 is decidedly an upscale unit. It has USB, bluetooth, stereo bluetooth, 2 megapixel camera, Opera Mini, memory card, records 3+minute videos, will hold numerous songs, works overseas, has excellent sound, a bright screen and sexy looks to boot. HOT and HAUGHT! It's a wonderful phone - more for the Dolce & Gabbana type than the 'down and dirty' type.",4,10
185517,Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Sunrise Gold - GSM - US Warranty,,"Fingerprint sensor completely stopped working.1 star. Returning yet another pos phone. I'm done buying phone's from Amazon because if I exchange this for new one I'll probably get a used refurbished one... No way of knowing. It should have no problems!!!. It's brand new.AND, IT WON'T LET ME MAKE NEW FINGERPRINT!!? CHINESE GARBAGE AS USUAL!It only works (SOMETIMES) if I restart the phone. I'm not keeping a phone that has to be restarted in order to get the fingerprint sensor working again! That shows it'll probably have more and greater issues down the road.

90527,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,"Finally! Too bad it took so long, but for me, this is the perfect business tool. Much better than the Q 10 and although the specs aren't up to the Passport standards, for an everyday email and basic app phone the Classic is just terrific. Blackberry, Keep updating and tweaking the specs for a Classic 2 in 2015 and the core Blackberry fans, like me, will be very happy. I would pay a bit more for a faster processor, better camera, etc. But right now, I'm very happy with my Classic. Why am I so excited to have the Classic? I've been using it now for a week and I am back to virtually error free productive typing. I was OK with the Q 10 keyboard but with no tool belt my finger kept hitting the screen by accident. That caused errors and really slowed my typing. Now, with the tool belt, I am so much more productive. Next, the trackpad makes it so much easier for me to edit. I would get frustrated hitting the screen with my fingers and not landing where I needed to be. The track pad works perfectly, just like a mouse.Yes, I do have an iPhone 6 which is my fun phone for apps, pictures and some personal and short emails and texts. And I love that one too. Both are excellent phones, but for different applications. I would want to have both and wish Blackberry much success so we see more and better Classics and other devices in the future. Right now the Classic is my perfect traveling productivity tool!",5,19
348914,Samsung Galaxy S5 G900V Verizon 4G LTE Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - Black - Verizon,Samsung,"Finally took the plunge & upgraded phone & service plan after 15 years....and I am BLOWN AWAY at the incredible reception in my area- almost all my friends & service people that come to the house get ZERO reception...and while I certainly can't pull in 4G in my area, at least I can GET calls now & haven't had them drop or garble as before. Being able to connect to WiFi is certainly a plus & provides excellent reception if the cellular connection is not strong...which, on certain days, depending upon the weather, happens. So far, this phone is everything I expected & more. Configuring has been fairly easy, but I am familiar with Android OS, so that helps. Still learning the ins & outs of the actual phone & text features, but again, everything has been fairly easy to do. I actually took this down to the local Verizon store & had them do the SIM installation & activation since I was clueless, so THAT was SUPER easy! Screen is AWESOME, colors/display incredible, & so far, I LOVE this phone....hopefully it will continue!! Will post updates as I use the phone more (if I remember, LOL)",5,1
181281,FIGO Atrium 5.5 - Dual Micro SIM Unlocked 16GB Smartphone - US & International GSM 4G LTE (Black),FIGO,"FIGO Atrium 5.5 is a pretty decent phone; you get what you paid for. Some things I did find that may be a turn off for some people: Opening some apps will be delayed for a couple of seconds and could cause slow down for high graphic games, the sound quality (the speaker is on the back of the phone) is alright, but it could be better. The battery may give you an 8-10 hour of use so have that charger around you. For the package, I did get everything except the headphones (not a big loss for me, I have better ones), and the case is weird because it doesn't stick on the phone very good, but hopefully the company can provide these phones with better cases. The FIGO Atrium 5.5 does take good, high-quality pictures (better with a good light source), watching videos in HD is always great (up to 1080p), calling and texting works right, and charging to full should take about 30 to 45 minutes if you can wait. Like most smartphones, this phone run on Android Lollipop 5.1 so you won't be left out. As a $120 budget phone, it can pretty much do what other smartphones can that are $400 or more, it is a steal! With that all said, please make sure you do your research first before buying, I took a gamble with this phone, and I like what I have. I hope my review helps! :)Update:I found the headphone, it was on the floor...However, the sound quality isn't that great, but it does have a pause/stop button and a mic if for whatever reason you still want to use it; just buy a better headset. Then again, you are buying mainly for the phone itself, the headphones just an added bonus.",4,91

223430,LG G4 H815T 32GB Leather Beige - Factory Unlocked GSM - International Version Phone No Warranty,LG,"Fantastic phone. Great features. Battery gets me through the day most days without issue. No lagging or stuttering. Great, fast camera. Beautiful display. Love the Knock Code, double-tap to (un)lock and Smart Lock features, though I find that the first two don't cooperate at times. I also think Smart Notice is pretty cool, especially because I like the notifications on battery-hogging apps and other such tips. It also provides weather via Accuweather, but I find that the forecast is wrong a lot. I wish I had the option to change to Open Weather or some other provider. Normally I use custom launchers like Nova, but I haven't felt the need to do that so far.I purchased both a beige leather and a red leather version. I actually prefer the beige (maybe because it's textured) but they're both beautiful. If you remove the back cover the leather doesn't feel particularly rich, because it's a very thin layer. But I've kept my phones in TPU cases and so far no wear or damage has shown (it's only been a month). I was worried about the phone size initially, even though I have big hands. But I adjusted to it quickly. My wife, who has much smaller hands, has been fine using hers as well. There will be times where single hand usage isn't possible, but you get use to it.I purchases the beige version through Open Wireless Group, and to my surprise it came with a spare plastic back cover as well.",5,3

244853,Moto Z Play - Black - 32GB (U.S. Warranty),Motorola,"Excellent phone for the money. If battery life is what you are looking for this is the phone you should buy. I can get two days of battery life. Sometimes into a third day. I average about 8:30 hours of screen on time but There have been times when I've gotten 10 hours. The battery life on this device is simply amazing.Don't be dissuaded by the Snapdragon 625 processor. This phone has NO LAG. It is one of the snappiest phones I've used. Unless you plan on using this phone primarily for hardcore gaming the processor won't be an issue for you at all. Even if you do want to game a lot it's not like you won't be able to but your frame rates and loading times will be a little slower than with a phone with a higher end processor.The display is beautiful. It's only 1080p and not 2K like a lot of flag ships but it is a gorgeous 1080p screen. My past 2 phones had 2k screens and this screen does not feel like a downgrade. In normal day to day use you won't be able to tell the difference.....AND....that 1080p screen is part of the reason the battery life is so good.The Motorola specific features(Moto Voice, Moto Display, Moto Actions etc) are nice and hard to live without once you get used to them.There are a few slight cons with this phone but none of them are deal breakers. It is a little unnecessarily large in my opinion. The bezels are a little large on all sides. The camera is acceptable but not great at all. The Motomods feel like an unnecessary gimmick to me. I have the speaker and it is nice but you can get better sound and more volume from $20 bluetooth speakers. The style shell mods are nice but I wish there were more options. You don't really need any of the battery mods because the battery life is already class leading. The projector is overpriced for what you are getting. The camera mod is not very good. Also The mods are a little more lose when attached to the Moto Z Play than when attached to the regular Moto Z or Moto Z force. I suspect the Z and Force have magnets on the bottom and top of the phone while the Z Play only has magnets on the bottom of the phone.All in all this is a great phone. Hard to beat for the money.",4,8

The camera is interpolated from 2.3MP up to 5 and does not focus, which is expected for the price point. (It still works well with detachable macro / wide angle lenses) 4G networking actually works on sub-AT&T GSM networks like Consumer Cellular. Overall it is awesome considering the current price. The phone doesn't get hot from charging or use, and yet it is not slow compared to other similar phones with the same 1GHz chipset.

I just received this yesterday, brand new. It came with Kitkat on it, today I tried to update to Android v6 Marshmallow and it only updated to Lollipop 5.0.1. I keep trying to update but it keeps saying my phone is already Up To Date. I contacted LG and they said that the phone, LG G3 D850 is available for the Marshmallow update. I then drove 70 miles away to a Corporate AT&T store, waited for over an hour, just for them to tell me that AT&T did do a rollout ( OTA ) of Android v6 Marshmallow for this device but they said there is nothing they can do to help me or to even get v6 on it. That only took about 3 minutes of my time for nothing. I currently use Straight Talk and inserted my SIM in and it worked for making calls. I didn't change the APN settings as I left it to its default of ATT Nextgenphone and was connected to my home WiFi when I did update to only Android 5.0.1. Upon me purchasing this product, I chose to ""Ask"" the Seller a question and utilizing the drop down menu to had select ""Customization"". Well, THEY or AMAZON replied back to me via email but they never answered my direct question. I had told the seller that if this phone didnt come with Marshmallow or there was a problem getting it that I will indeed return it. All they said was something in the lines that I'll be pleased with this product. Another thing....the BRIGHTNESS on this phone is still dim no matter how high you turn it up as if it had like a tint look to it. This is not tolerable. Prior to buying this product, I had purchased the BLUE version of this from Edge Cellular which came as used but I knew it before hand but it was more than used then anything when I received it. Had hairline cracks on all outer edges as well a Red Dot on the screen which I had taken that to a ATT store and they said that was indication that the screen is about to go at some given point. The Blue version of this from Edge Cellular came with Android v6 Marshmellow, I am not sure how they even managed that when this Metallic Black one that is New isn't getting updated to Marshmallow. So in reality of it all, the Description of this Model number has to be wrong when it says its upgradeable to v6. Did a google search and seems it can be done ""IF"" you get the phone ROOTED with CyanogenMod 13. So overall, I do not suggest for Anyone to buy this particular Model from any seller and/or Amazon. Again, seems that sellers seem to neglect customers questions to them and if they do reply, don't expect them to reply to your exact question.

I do not like to give anyone remote access to my laptop or phone, so this for me is not a solution, also I want an answer!I am open to changing my review, because I actually like this phone for the most part. Nonetheless I do have some concerns:* they do not come with Bluetooth, but with a similar system with a different icon. The user manual on Posh's website clearly indicates that the Titan HD500 should come with Bluetooth - and the proper Bluetooth symbol should appear on our settings, but the phone comes with something else. The discrepancy between the manual and the actual settings worries me. I am concerned that maybe I received a lesser version of the phone?* Memory/storage issues - The phone comes with 8GB of internal memory, out of which only 1.44 are available for apps. I have 4.12 GD of phone storage that I am not using for anything - since I have an SD Card. Although I have selected SD Card as the preferred install location for new apps, the phone does not allow me to install new apps even though i have 4.2 GB of phone storage, 9.GB of SD card storage available, because my internal storage is almost full.",1,2

Read on:* It is simply too big. After a Bowie-knife, a roll of duct-tape and a wallet stuffed with partially filled free-sandwich cards, I really don't have room in my pockets for the paper-back book this phone attempts to be.* The camera is somehow always blurry. This is great for pictures of my deep-Appalachian family, but not so useful for insurance-shots of deer, bears and other wild animals that break into my house and steal my electronics and gold-bars.* The ""wood-style-back"" is, well... very roughly 'styled' after wood. A wood that shows oily fingerprints and feels like cheap plastic. My original MotoX had real wood backing. Somehow I missed that ""wood-style"" means ""not wood anymore"".

Further, if a repair is required, Samsung will lock the phone for use on AT&T only.Before I bought the phone, I contacted the Amazon seller (Mobile Hotspot) for warranty information. They referred me to Amazon who referred me to the manufacturer. The manufacturer's website states that this model is covered by a one-year manufacturer's warranty. I then ordered it from Amazon. When it stopped working about two weeks after I received it, I contacted Samsung for a warranty repair. Samsung refused to honor the warranty! After many contacts by on-line chat, telephone, and email, I finally escalated the contact to a manager. I learned that the Samsung warranty does not apply to units purchased through Amazon.com. According to the Samsung manager, Amazon is not an authorized Samsung dealer. It does not print the IMEI and Serial Number on the invoice. An invoice from an authorized dealer that shows the date of purchase and identifies the phone with the IMEI and Serial number is required to receive warranty service. The manager agreed to offer a repair as a ""one-time only customer courtesy."" However, if they make the repair, my unlocked phone will be returned to me, no longer unlocked, but locked to enable use on AT&T only. I do not have an AT&T account, so the phone would be useless to me even if it is repaired.This phone may or may not be a good phone when it is working, but I did not have it long enough to find out. It is now on its way back to Amazon, along with the various accessories I also purchased. I will look elsewhere for an unlocked GSM Android phone.",1,8

I freaked out and requested an immediate return authorization because I could not use the phone and did not see where the memory card slot is. The start up guide said nothing about where the memory card slot is located. By the light of day and after a quick stop at the AT&T service center, they explained that the sim card used in this phone is ""micro"". It took about three minutes for them to get me the correct size sim card and I was still able to keep the same phone number.They also showed me how the slot for the memory card is stacked on top of the slot for sim 1.In short, yes this phone has dual sim slots as well as a memory card slot.If when I get back to Costa Rica and I can get the same service from ICE Cel, I am good to go.Phone came packaged with charger, ear bud and a very limited information start up guide.

The cheaper Tracfone card is available, and I'll ask my daughter to take another try when she has time, but she has her own job and family to take care of.

382660,Samsung SCH-i545 - Galaxy S4 16GB Android Smartphone - Verizon + GSM - Blue (Certified Refurbished),,"Bought it to be a replacement for my current traveling companion: a Samsung Galaxy Player 5. (The Player is not a phone, and I didn't buy the S4 to be a phone, so I probably didn't have to bother buying ""unlocked"", but that's my problem). The physical screen sizes of the two devices are identical, but obviously the greater resolution on the S4 was the big selling point to me for what I thought would be a simple hardware refresh.I knew going in that I was trading in two rear-facing speakers (GP5) for one (GS4). I didn't know that the S4 just can't get the same volume as the Player5. So it won't be useful for music or vid without earbuds. I also didn't realize that there's no GPS on the S4 - again, my bad. I should have looked harder than I did at the S4's specs. The S4 relies for network feedback to establish location. The Amazon description said the S4's OS would be 4.2.2, consistent with the OS info listed at Best Buy's website (the retailer for which these blue i545s were exclusively made). But it arrived with KitKat (4.4.2), which is probably fine for most people in the unlocked market, but I still don't like it. It's going to present problems with SD card access and how I use several of my music and reading apps - problems with which I'm already familiar and which prompted me to buy a piece of hardware sooner rather than waiting it out for lower prices later: I wanted something before everything is shipped with KitKat or later.FInally, power. For running it Wi-Fi only, the back of the S4 got warm to the touch after minimal use, and I went from a fully charged 100% battery to 79% in practically no time at all. I had already ordered a replacement battery directly from Verizon, so we'll see if a new battery makes a difference in drain. I'll mod the review if it behaves better.On the upside: it obviously takes way better pictures than the Galaxy Player; the higher resolution makes reading a treat; it includes Samsung's multi-app bar which allows you to run two apps simultaneously; the light weight makes it that much better for mobile use; an OS beyond the Player5's hard-limit Gingerbread opens up a wider assortment of apps, and who wouldn't like 2GB RAM instead of 0.5, right?

57603,Apple iPhone 6 Plus 64GB Gold (Factory Unlocked),Apple,"Bought from Apple Express Electronics and was satisfied with the promptness and courtesy of the seller. Item arrived new and sealed, as advertised! Came with a Verizon sim but hey, I'm glad the iPhone comes with CDMA and GSM antennas, so activating with AT&T was as easy as sticking in the respective sin and going through the usual activation process.The iPhone 6 Plus itself is HUGE, but everyone knows that by now. I do look at it in comparison with other phablets and think that Apple should rethink the top part to make the phone slightly shorter (maybe placing the front camera, the sensor and speaker all in a raw) or maybe rethinking the internal arrangement of parts. Other than size it is a very nice and slick looking device. Yes, some may say, base on the front panel, that it is just an iPhone but blown up. Although true, it is slim enough and the back (although probably inspired by the HTC M8) makes it look like a very premium phone. I personally miss the glass back of the iPhone 4 and 4S but can probably understand that said choice is more prone to cracked phones.I will not go into details on the performance of the phone. You can visit YouTube and just search for the details on that. However, I can say that it provides a very smooth experience going from one page to another, opening and exiting apps and accessing the control center and notification menu. This has to be taking into consideration as it is not as spec heavily as say the Galaxy Note 4 or the Xperia Z3 or many other android phones that have very impressing internals. Yet the iPhone works with what it has and works really good. The camera is still 8MP but the photos and videos are gorgeous. Maybe his is one of few reasons why Apple prides itself on quality and justifies its price tag. ...but I think the phone should be at least $50 cheaper for all models!IOS is simple and works well I a big phone. I wished it had home screen widgets and more customization options other folders but iOS isn't a broke OS. It works fine all around. I like finally being able to rotate my phone on the home screen (although a minor detail to some, it is more than welcomed and I think should be on all iOS devices). The bigger screen makes it easier for me to tipe and enjoy stuff in safari or other apps that are customized forbthebiphone 6 Pkus.The battery? I am charging my phone every 2 days with moderate use; day and a-half with heavy use.It's a good, solid phone!

398668,Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked GSM IP58-Certified WaterProof Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera and Dust Resistant - White,Sony,"Bluetooth and wifi HARDWARE problems out of the box. no fix for it, google it before purchasing! (pushing on the back case clips back in the component to make it temporarily work)This review is based on a four day experience with the phone on at&t, I am a power user so I had plenty of time to get frustrated with it.PROS: Great size, sd card slot, camera button, battery life, notification light/bar, water resistant (I would never try to claim water proof on an electronic device), great specs.CONS: EXTREMELY washed out and over saturated screen, bluetooth and wifi do not work on my particular device and is a common problem, 0.3 megapixel front facing camera (should have just excluded it as its useless), volume button location should be above power button.I will start out by saying I chose this phone because I only use phones that are able to be used one handed. This one stretches the capabilities of that over my preferred 4.3"" screens but the low bezel makes it easier then all the others. I have been waiting months for the z1 compact to come stateside and grew impatient and decided to try a similar phone to get used to the sony platform.Sony's ui is certainly not sense or touchwiz quality but it does provide some beautiful icons and apps but is missing alot of features.The screen on this device is horrible, facebook, snapchat, instagram, youtube apps looks oddly colored due to this. Very over saturated and washed out. facebook is purple compared to the normal blue you would expect to see on any other device. custom roms may or may not fix this, I never got the chance to root my device.Rear camera takes amazing photos, camera app is odd coming from cm11 and sense but is feature rich. I mistakingly never read the specs on the front camera and it turned out to be a horrible mistake. Front camera is 0.3 megapixels with no focus. unusable.Battery life is amazing! I have never had a phone that could keep up with my usage and not need three or four bateries swapped out during theday. This device literally lasted all day on a charge and asked for more.I would not recommend this device to anyone. There are plenty other devices out there that surpass the specs for this big of a screen. Feel free to comment or ask any questions.",1,1

The phone has better volume than my last BLU. Though I have not yet carried it through all the situations which my last BLU suffered, It looks more rugged. I will need to find a case for it. The seemingly nothing case that came with my last studio 5.5 protected it better than a much heaver case I used on my Galaxy. I expect this unit to do as well or better with a little protection. The tablet function is greatly increased because of size , the camera is much better. The shape is right and it will still fit into the front pocket of my slacks or jeans in a pinch.

261274,NOKIA 6682 CINGULAR AT&T GSM CELL PHONE,,"Being a diehard Nokia fan, I had made my mind to buy my third nokia. Esp after this incident:My earlier nokia 6610 spent 45 minutes with me in a pool, before I realized its presence in my pocket. Well, I dried it in sunlight and then with a hair-dryer, cleaned the copper connectors (to remove the oxidation products) with after-shave and it works w/o any problem. Kudos to Nokia..!!Coming back to 6682, I have this phone for about 5 days now and have explored most of its features by now. Here are my views:Looks: Impressive and very smooth.Size: Not too big. Comparable to other phones with similar features available now. Foam/leather cover with belt clip is a good option to have (Caution: Dont buy the plastic clip from Amazon, its terrible). You would certainly love to show this kool phone to others :)Basic Features: Signal strength, battery life- really good Display - Awesomely brilliant. Includes LED to detect the surrounding light and adjust the display. Speakerphone - Very good, Mic can catch my voice from across the room. Menu - Easy to explore. Might take a day or two to get used to.Kool Features:Camera - 1.3 MP, good quality. Flash-OK. Camera options include self timer for 10,20, 30 seconds, high-speed sequence mode, night mode and brightness, color, contrast adjustments. (thats a sure +)Editing: Photo n video editing....wowSpeakerphone - Excellent volume n quality to play mp3s n videos mp4, rm.Documents - Can view word, excel, powerpoint n pdfs. Can edit them if you buy authorization code for the QuickOffice software online for $15.OS: Sometimes goes slow depending on the applications running. Otherwise Ok for general use.Internet: Good quality (I m using the basic one )Recorder: Excellent audio recorder and voice commands. Dont know the video recording capability nowConnectivity: Bluetooth - standard Cable - With included USB cable connects to PC and then you can simply copy-paste the documents, images, songs etc.Memory - RS MMC, (1 GB card is abt $30 on amazon..pretty ok)COST- IT IS FREE (r u kidding me..???)Thoughts: If you are really really used to small phone, then it might feel very big initially.I cant comment on the internet download speed etc as I do not have a high speed data plan. Normal Media/Browser runs OK.Update after 10 weeks: 1. Pictures with flash in a low light place like restaurant might come out a bit grainy.2. RS-MMC memory is hard to find except at Amazon, that too occassionally.3. You cannot assign tones to different callers.Update after 7 months:1. You can assign separate tones for callers alongwith their pictures.2. You can record video with sound.3. Once Synched with Outlook (even w/o data plan), this phone is great to keep your emails and calendar updated!",5,38
90131,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,"Being a Blackberry user for 5 years, I did want to like the new Classic Blackberry. It has a nice interface, good screen, and fantastic keyboard. However, there was a 2 major flaws with the battery on my phone which is why I am giving the phone only 2 stars. First, on my unit, once you power the unit off, it will NOT power back on until its connected to a power source i.e. pressing the top power button does not turn it on. Second, the battery barely makes it through half a day. Having seen the other reviews, I am guessing I may have a faulty device so am returning my phone and have ordered a new one from Amazon. Am hoping that the new device will be better. Also called Blackberry support, and they were willing to do a warranty exchange on the phone but returning is to Amazon is easier. However, am really disappointed at the quality control or rather lack of quality control with these new phones, and am hoping the new phone will be better.",2,8
331108,Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 16GB Gray-Unlocked International Phone No Warranty,,"Before you decide to buy this phone, please spend five minutes to read my story.I purchased this phone from this seller at Amazon.com On December 12th, 2012.I cost me $639.11 at that time.It is perfect great for the first eleven months until novermber 10, 2013.It is suddenly dead with no reason. I tried all my way to solve the problem.(Changed a new battery. Hard reset and SOft reset.) But nothing happened.I called Samsung US. They told me I cannot get the manufacturer warranty from thembecause this is a international model. I have to find the particular manufacturerto ask them to get the warranty. They help me and figure out this is a UK model.Then I called Samsung UK and they took a week and told me they have no responsibilityfor this phone according to my IMEI number. This phone wasmade by Samsung Saudi Arabiaand then they give me a phone number in Saudi Arabia.Finally, I found the Samsung Saudi Arabia website and sent an email to them.They replied me and told me that manufacturer warranty is not for international customerand only for their domestic customer.I opened my Note II and found the words ""made by Samsung Vietnam"".I wrote an email to them and get the same result.They don't give the international customer manufacturer warranty.In the same time, I contact the seller about the issue.They reply me the phone has no manufacturer warranty.Why they don't tell users in advance.Now my 11 months old dead phone sleeps in my drawer.I don't know what I can do.Also I would appreciate If any one can let me know what I can do.---------------------------------------------------------------------To be honest, I don't want to get rid of my previous review wrote in Jan, 2013.The phone is great.

264709,"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",Nokia,"Because, this is my first smartphone experience (I've never even played with one before), please put this review into context.I bought this phone when Amazon did a one day $200 sale on the phone, because my wife needed a smartphone for a new job. She's Japanese, so she's used to high tech, next gen phones, but she's never been a phone person. In Japan you can get phones with crazy features that are still easy to use. I also liked the fact that you can use this phone as a stand alone GPS device without having the service. The phone actually is great for that, even though the screen is small. Needless to say the phone was too complected for my wife to like. She's very busy and doesn't have time that this phone needs to figure out.I fell in love with it, because I like thinner flip phones, and this phone wasn't much bigger than my Samsung flip, one of the worlds thinnest. So you can throw this thing in your pocket, and it's not going to anywhere as bulky as an iphone. I also like the solid construction and the steel case. The phone isn't cheaply made. The keys are white, as others have said, not silver like the pic, but I think it looks good. It's an off white, not a bright white, so it doesn't really clash. The letters and characters are back lit, and you can set the phone to slowly pulsate light from the phone on standby.I do like complicated toys, but this one was a bit much. Granted, I don't know about blackberres, et al. The main issue was the fact that I hate AT&T. I hate the a la carte menu plan style that charges you more for every little thing. The phone runs on T-Mobile, which is what I ordered, because I have good experience with them previously. This phone doesn't get 3G on T-mobile. The phone jumps on wifi signals around you with no problem, so I just used my home network. If you're gonna buy a phone like this, you need AT&T, and then you might as well get a Nokia E71x, which is the same thing, just black and cheaper with an AT&T contract. I use Sprint normally and can get unlimited everything for a two phones, for what it almost costs to get the same level of service on one phone from AT&T. With T-mobile, if you don't buy a phone from them, their smartphone service is 20 bucks cheaper a month. that's $480 dollars over a 2 year contract. Think about that for a second if surfing the web a lot without wifi is important to you. The phone isn't good at that anyway. If you wanted to surf the web without a computer, then get an iphone or Droid.Because it's unlocked, it's basically like you bought it in Europe. The phone has an uber chic European style about it for those that want to be artsy and businesy at the same time, but I think you really need the support of an American carrier. AT&T supports this phone, so its probably better on their network all the way around. There are functions that don't work in the US. There are other functions, like the music store, that ask you to list what country you'd like to buy from and then give you the choice of 50 or more other countries, but not the US. The online music channel player literally gives you thousands of options for dance music alone, per country. You can listen to a European dance station called Gay radio Europe, or country music from the US. That's cool, but that's too many options. It would bug me to know that I'll never hear all of them and wonder if whatever station I was listening to is the right one. The phone is like a pretentious Western European looking down on you (stretched metaphor).The camera's kind of crappy for resolution. Just a bit better than my 4 year old flip phone 2mp camera. If that's important to you, then get the Nokia E72.Screen resolution is fine, but will win no awards. Its not like the new droid phones. I played with a bunch of phones at the Sprint store after getting this phone, and the pre was by far the easiest and most intuitive to use. Think of the Palm Pre as the antithesis of this phone. I used the Youtube app that came with it to watch videos on wifi, and there was zero problem. The speaker is actually pretty good, and the speaker phone is great.Using the internet is a pain with the cursor, and there's no touchscreen. Using Opera for mobiles, the speed was great on wifi, but you have to zoom out over the whole page, move cursor where you want, and then zoom back in. If you really need to surf the web a lot with a phone, which I don't, then this isn't the phone for you. It has all the business stuff on it.The keys are ridiculously small, but even with my big thumbs with wasn't too hard to type on. Very few missed keys. The pain in typing for me was actually holding such a small phone with two hands and typing. Easier one handed. It's easier than typing on the Palm Pre, which is really bad.The Nokia apps store is terrible as well. Not a lot of stuff. It uses a Symbian OS, which is a Linux OS, so you might be able to use android apps. Don't know.The software the phone came with, something like 9 programs, were a pain. You can use them when you connect your phone to the computer, and can actually use the phone as a wireless modem, but they are a pain in the ass to use, not very intuitive or multi functional (they are buggy as well).Due to this I only had the phone for 2 days, and I sent it back. Again, with T-mobile there's not much point. I'm also more of a flip phone or multimedia touchscreen phone guy, not a full QWERTY guy. I don't text a lot. If the phone ran on 3G Sprint, which I've been on for 3 years now, then I'd probably just keep the phone for myself and buy my wife something else. Looking for a way to format the phone before returning it, I actually looked in the instruction booklet and saw how many things I was misunderstanding with the phone. If you don't like reading the whole manual, don't get the phone. It's an easy manual to read though.",3,1

I will adjust this if they surprise me and either repair or replace my phones, but reading other reviews, it doesn't look like that will happen. I purchased two phones, one for myself and one for my daughter, and this was early on, when the reviews were still glowing, before everyone started having the exact same problems I am. I didn't expect an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, but I expected, with the specs and reviews up until that point, last Christmas, to get a decently functioning smartphone at a good price. and for a few months, that's what we had. Then things started going downhill. My daughter's bettery went kaput. I could literally watch it drain away, percent by percent, in minutes. They did replace that with few hassles, after originally wanting me to send the whole phone back in (I refused knowing it was the battery and they did concede and send a new one). But then her phone started to only work on speaker. A month or so later, the same happened to mine. Ever so convenient when in a crowded place, to try to talk on speakerphone! And sometimes it doesn't even work. Mine also has become pixelated at the top and bottom of the screen. I have finally gotten a cheapo older model (though really, probably better) phone to use for awhile while I send these in to be fixed/replaced, one at a time. We will see if that happens, or if they just send them back claiming ""water damage"" or ""physical damage"" instead of manufacturer's defect, the only thing they cover. I fail to see how two phones can have the exact same problem that isn't a defect with the phone...and I've seen other reviews on here talking about the same issue. There hasn't been water or other physical damage to these phones. I do hope that I can adjust this review to be more positive but I don't hold a lot of hope...",1,1

85683,Blackberry 9530 Storm Unlocked For Any GSM Carrier Worldwide,BlackBerry,"Be Wireless should rename itself to B.S. Wireless because whoever is running this business does not know what they are doing, I asked for an unlocked phone for any GSM carrier and I get instead a CDMA phone, the 1st of the two phones did not work and had to be returned, the 2nd phone they sent me did show signs of life, it worked, I was able to charge it. But after all this, I ran out of the funds needed to activate the phone for September, so I had to wait until October 1st to activate the 2nd phone. Well the 1st carrier I tried was Net10, they couldn't activate it over the phone so I took the phone to a brick and mortar phone store, only to find out that this phone is not unlocked, the previous owner had Verizon and it is still locked on Verizon. Well as you can imagine, I'm boiling mad at the moment, I never expected that anything like this would ever happen by dealing with Amazon.com because all my previous purchases through them were excellent. I could probably just ask the seller for the unlock code, but at this point I just want to get a refund and go to someone with more experience with cell phone products.",1,1

I must give special credit to NGP because when I e-mailed them regarding one of the technical issues I was having (see below), they actually had a tech rep from their company give me a call and we worked together to figure out an issue with the phone. It was nice to have them go that extra step for me!Note: IF you are using the X Perf with a T-Mobile SIM card, there is a bug or issue that occurs where when you try to edit a contact using the stock Contacts app, it will keep closing out on you. Take the T-Mobile SIM card out, and it's fine. It's not big deal really (I had a couple other issues too aside from this on the one I returned). Just get the Contacts+ app from the Play Store (or something like that) and you can just use that to arrange & edit your contacts with no problems! I also use CallApp which has an advanced caller ID feature on it that uses social media to figure out who's calling you. It's very accurate pretty much 100% of the time.

But I must say that I'm extremely happy with the switch! I was going from a Samsung galaxy S2 to the Nokia lumia 1020. I also own a Mac and an iPad. So I have had the chance to shop and each market and get a feel for how they all work and features they bring. To be honest with you the windows at market has everything that I need (apps). And actually I like shopping in the windows market better because there's less junky apps to have to go sort through. I feel the phone is very intuitive and it's just as easy for me to get from one place to another as it was on my galaxy. Actually, probably easier, but I am comparing to an older galaxy so that's probably a given. I've had the phone for about a week now so I've had a chance to really play with it a lot. There are only a few things that bother me about phone. This phone drains the battery! Granted I was on it a lot playing on it a lot in the beginning, but it would not last me over five hours. I searched for how to extend the battery life and changed some settings and it seemed to help a little bit. But, I can usually go at least two days on my galaxy S2 and I can usually go about three days on my iPad with the same amount of usage without having to recharge. I definitely have to recharge this baby everyday, sometimes twice a day. The only other complaint is the voice feature, I always used voice a lot on my iPad and galaxy for search engines, commands, texting etc. Windows phone does a pretty decent job and it picks up my voice relatively well. Actually it probably does better than the iPad 3. But I miss being able to use punctuation while I'm talking. I haven't found a way to add commas periods or exclamation points. So after I use voice to say my sentences or paragraphs I have to go back in and add my punctuation. I will say that it usually knows and I'm the end of the sentence and will add the period, however it does not get the rest my punctuation. This is really annoying to me because I'm trying to be hands-free. Hopefully I can find a way to change this but I haven't found a way as of yet. Otherwise if you are leaning towards a switch from android or I phone to a Windows phone, I do not think you'll be disappointed. By the way I'm writing this review on my iPad using voice to text. I should've done it from my phone so you could see what I'm talking about with the punctuation.",4,1

81730,"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Gold (U.S. Warranty) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",Asus,"Asus has shown the industry how to design and manufacture a powerful device at a very affordable price. I spent several weeks looking for a replacement phone (Galaxy S4). After reading many reviews and watching a variety of reviews on youtube I placed my order. I could not be more pleased. This phone is without a doubt one of the most powerful smartphones on the market and you will not be disappointed. Yes. the back cover is plastic. However, like me, you're going to put a case on this to protect it and it simply won't matter. Despite being plastic, the back cover fits snugly. Many of the reviews outlined a dim screen. Candidly, it's fine. The second big concern I read about was bloatware... well, show me a phone today that does not come loaded... What most reviewers fail to tell you is that you can delete / remove whatever you want. So far, every app I have installed has worked perfectly. Every feature of the phone has worked very well. The battery life is great. I get 24 to 30 hours on a charge consistently, and I use the phone... This has been such a great phone I purchased a second for my daughter. Asus is great... they have released three updates for the phone which installed perfectly. So, bottom line, I would challenge you to find a better deal feature for feature from any other well known manufacturer. Purchase one, you won't be disappointed.",5,5

Before I purchased it, I did some research into whether or not I could still use the phone if I had a monthly contract. And I could. All I had to do was call T-Mobile and tell them that I no longer needed a Blackberry data plan and needed their Android one.Pro's:-It's easily rootable. All one has to do is download some drivers for your computer, some app's, and voila. You're done. In fact, rooting your device is encouraged by many in the Android community; unlike those who own iOS devices (Apple actually frowns upon people who do so).-Plenty of apps that you would find on Apple's devices, you can easily find on Android. For example, Siri. Instead, we Android users have something called Iris.-Unlike Apple products, this Android phone actually has a flash for its' camera. Since I take plenty of pictures, I expect my camera's to have flash.Con's:The one thing that really bothers me about this phone is that I couldn't hear people text me when I had the phone locked. With my Blackberry, it would make a noise. It's not a big gripe since I was able to find an app on the Market that took care of this for me. It's called Handcent SMS in case anyone is interested.Otherwise, this phone is perfect!",5,5

260161,NOKIA 301.2 FACTORY UNLOCKED QUADBAND 3G 850/1900 WORLD PHONE - BLACK,Nokia,"An avid smartphone user for 6 years now, I bought this 301 this week to augment my Berry for those weekends and other times when I don't need the full pocket computer rolling. Battery life has been solid so far. Need to still do a full run-down test, yet the four bars keep staying on for a nice, long time. This review is a first impression.Don't let the 1990's look fool you, it's packing 3.5G (T-Mobile 4G for me) underneath this fully global, quad-band factory unlocked package. For not much more than a dual-band, I upgraded to the quad-band for some planned travel this coming year, and this should do the job quickly and happily. While it's nice to be ""unplugged"" from back home, it's a solid setup to be able to tie into web browsing and the email apps for Google, Yahoo, and Exchange built in. This won't replace your typical 4-6"" touch screen device for video consumption, however it loaded up my 32GB SD card that I use in my other device and played audio tracks within two minutes.I don't see this replacing my smartphone needs with work and such, however it has been a joy as a number two phone, ideal for those nights out when you are expecting a phone call/text and may want to hop on the web while waiting in line or whatnot. Bust out this 301 and pop onto the Xpress Browser or email your friend on their big screen pocket computer/phone and be prepared to see some shocked faces. This thing cooks. I wish that it would be sold in stores, however I'm a happy Amazon customer and this device seems to hit a nice medium between ""dumb phone"" and ""smart phone"" with sharp, near landline call quality and quick T9 typing.With the ability to quickly swap out the SIM from my Berry to this 301, I've got a fun and useful duo for the same price as compared to upgrading to popular 32 GB models of other smartphones, while using the latest iterations of some longtime players in this still, relatively new field.In sum, I'm impressed. I haven't had a Nokia since before my work BlackBerry days, yet I can tell you this, this is a great second SIM phone for those of us tethered to those devices and a solid telecommunication device, complete with up to date wireless tech baked in. If you're looking for a phone that does the talking thing with a clear voice, look no further.",5,25

(Model#: X511 BLACK)",,"After switching from an IPhone to an android Galaxy S4 and loving the user-friendly and customizable features of android I was heartbroken when the screen on my S4 cut out leaving me scrambling for a new phone. I decided that, like most mid-twenty white girls, I wanted the larger screen for my cell phone as well so that I too can take unnecessary mirror selfies and slay.I scoured Amazon for a few days comparing the under $100 android unlocked phones. Despite the desperate need to look fly, I'm ballin on a budget. Riding broke bitch status, ya feel me? Anyway. I read review after review of the Posh Titan HD 550 and all seemed positive. Watched unboxing videos and reviews on YouTube and decided to go with this phone. I was elated the day it arrived. Couldn't wait. Selfie time. BAM! watched me!After a few days of use I noticed the phone started to slow down. Touch screen response time was under-par and the camera was...frankly it was s*** and the beauty cam feature was comical at best. The phone boasts a 13mp camera but what is that when the display can't give justice to its own features? The video even lagged like a ghost trail of I was recording my daughter playing or even opening gifts on her bday.Battery life was the WORST of any smart phone I've ever owned. My phone stayed on the charger constantly. And if it died, you can forget it. An overnight charge was lucky to get you 70%. It did do this weird quick charge thing where it went from 5% to 100% in 10 minutes but then without warning it would die before I'd even get home and that was with the phone just on standby.Hated it.

Some said that it was fake, or that the battery life on the device was terrible, so I was prepared to return it if it were not real. I purchased this on June 29, 2016 and received it on July 1, 2016. When handed the box from the UPS deliverer, it was in great shape. I slid the Samsung Galaxy S6 box out of the one it was shipped in, and was glad to see that THE SEAL WAS NOT BROKEN, and was the correct color. I then opened the box and saw the phone with all of the original accessories included. Unfortunately it is the international version and there is no warranty provided. So I made some calls and found out that you can PURCHASE 2 YEARS of warranty off of Samsung.com. When you search for ""Protection Plus"" a screen will appear, providing you with the option of buying 2 YEARS OF WARRANTY for $99.00. The phone works fantastic and is lightning quick. Its battery life is great and It is totally worth the purchase. I decided to write this review to include things that I wish others would have included. Lastly, I use MetroPCS and it works great. Also, there are many unanswered comments on other post like ""Who was your seller"" or ""Who'd you buy from"". I'll gladly tell you that I purchased this device from lifeline786. He shipped quick and answered many questions that I asked through email, almost immediately. Some say that the model code on this phone is fake ""SM-G920F"" but it's not. This model code means that it is a global version of the phone. Hope this helps! :)",5,33

I am highly disappointed and will NOT buy any Zenphone by Asus in the future.update: the phone was sent to ASUS for repair since it is within the warranty. They then want $124 for fixing the screen. I replied by saying I am not interested in fixing the screen (the phone was still working even with the crack) and all I want is the software problem to be fixed. However they refuse to do ""partial fix to this model"". This is just RIDICULOUS.

Sure, it helps against little scratches and bumps but no more than a cheaper, thinner, easier to install/remove case. The first time the phone was ever dropped, while in the case and from only about 3 feet high, the screen shattered, and in a manner that was worse than any other time my wife has broken her screen. This time the phone was completely useless as the screen went black. Why pay more and deal with the difficult to install/remove case for something that clearly doesn't work. I recommend checking out some of the other rugged cases offered as this one is anything but - we haven't tried any others yet but will be looking.I mention how difficult the phone is to remove because my wife takes it out in order to use it with an arm band for running. Goes from the case to the arm band back to the case. It's quite a hassle. Would be expected and acceptable if the case actually performed and protected the phone - which it didn't.",1,3

I was a loyal Galaxy client because I had been, so far, satisfied with the S3 and S4 I had gotten over the years.When the phone arrived, it seemed to be in good condition, however, I made a discovery that had me regretting having bought this phone... the CAMERA sucks! When I say the camera sucks, I mean it sucks... really bad. Compared with the cameras of the S3 and S4, the quality was not good at all: really grainy images from both front and back cameras with the selfie camera being the worse of the two. No matter how much I tried adjusting the settings, the camera's images did not compare to what I had before. I appreciated the other features/specs but the quality camera I was used to left me so disappointed with this phone I ended up paying a thousand bucks in my currency for that I could not give the phone the 5 stars I would've given its predecessors.Samsung, I am so disappointed in this product (and in wasting my hard earned money on this phone) that I will try the iPhone next (and I prefer Windows to Apple).

411292,"ZTE Axon Pro - Factory Unlocked Phone, 32 GB Ion Gold (U.S. Warranty)",ZTE,"After a lifetime of Samsung, HTC and LG smartphones, I decided to take a chance on the ZTE Axon - my first unlocked device and first ZTE phone. I am using it on AT&T's network. After reading forums, product reviews and doing comparisons, I jumped in to see what the hype was about.Let me start by saying this thing is smoking fast - it has a Snapdragon 810 chip set with 4 GB RAM, which means that flipping through screens, watching movies, playing with the camera/video and even gaming has been great. This is more memory than I had in my last device (LG G3) and it shows. I have not yet had a hang, stutter or anything. One reviewer mentioned the phone heating up. I personally have not experienced this in my usage and I have been throwing a lot of stuff at it. This thing is fast!I got the pfthalo blue color with gold trim and it is stunning. I receive comments on it regularly as it looks unlike most other boring black devices out there. The phone is metal and feels very solid - hard to believe that I paid what I did for it. It has a mono speaker but the volume is loud and sound is clear. I would have preferred stereo speakers but have used this for conference calls on speakerphone and it hasn't caused an issue yet. I get the impression that ZTE put a ton of effort into the Axon and it does indeed feel like a flagship offering with lots of attention paid to details, textures, components, etc. Just what I am looking for in a cool device that I want to use every day and feel good doing it.As a few other reviewers have noted, the camera on the Axon is excellent. It gives me great options like slow motion, multi-exposure, panorama, HDR, time lapse and more along with a bevy of manual f stop and camera controls if I want to tweak it to my experience. I can even adjust the depth of field AFTER my photo is taken, something that gives me a great look if I forget to adjust ahead of time. I did not notice any aberrations or color issues when I transferred them to my computer and blew them up. Video is sharp and fluid as well.It may sound trite, but the screen is just flat-out gorgeous. Great contrast, viewing angle, etc. - what everyone should be looking for. Colors were bright and accurate and everything I did on it looked great, from Netflix to web to games. Seriously, I am impressed with this screen. My wife's Samsung showed colors brighter but they were almost unnatural to a degree because of the OLED screen. I prefer realism, just as I intended when I take photos or watch movies.My Axon Pro came with 32GB memory but no microSD slot. At first I thought this may be an issue, but the more I thought about it, it's easiest just to back things up to the cloud or on my computer and when I looked at all the photos and music I already had loaded onto the phone, I still had tons of room left. So this is not an issue for me.I'll end by saying this has changed my entire outlook on ZTE as a company. I used to think of them for prepaid low-end phones over the years but the Axon changes everything. I have recommended this phone to family members and friends and I remind them that it does virtually everything their more expensive phones do but at a fraction of a price. I paid only $450 for all of this!Sorry, Samsung, I am done paying $800 (or more) for a phone - never again. Well done, ZTE! You've gained a new fan.",5,1

I do not want an all touch-screen phone, so I think this will work for me. It also records short videos, something else my Cosmos (later model than the Rival) didn't do, which I really like. And, probably the best feature, the battery has a VERY long life and you don't have to charge it every couple of days. Good phone.",4,7

If you read anywhere that it's on an older Android version, that information is outdated. This phone has now been upgraded to 4.0, and if you buy it, it'll come with 4.0 already installed. I bought this phone after having an Android 1.5 phone for too long.The Galaxy S Blaze 4G came out about a year ago, but I don't think it'll become dated anytime too soon. It's basically the same as the Samsung Galaxy S2, with a few minor things missing (like HDMI port). So, if you want a phone from the Galaxy family, and don't want to pay too much, I strongly recommend this one. Plus, Tmobile is currently installing an LTE network, so I don't think it makes much sense to pay a lot of money for the Galaxy S3 which is on HSPA+. The Galaxy S Blaze 4G is on HSPA+, but it's cheaper, and a great phone to have until LTE is fully up and running, IMO. I don't do too many crazy things with this phone, but this phone has everything most people use smartphones for.I love the size, it's about the size of an iPhone. It might be marginally smaller than the Galaxy S2. So, if you're looking for something about as big as the iPhone or S2 (as opposed to the giant S3 and S4), this is your phone.",5,13

This is a great phone / tablet for the money. No it is not a flagship phone. It does not have LTE. But then again it does not cost $700 either.IMHO, the people who rate this with 1 or 2 stars are just abusing the amazon comment/rating system. I wish amazon would investigate and remove as appropriate. The abuse should be easy to spot.Answer to my dreams: Big screen, Small size, Light weight, Low priceI think of this as a great compromise device. Usability/Connectivity/Budget Price (1) You get a nice looking 7"" screen. (makes everything much easier to read) (2) You get faster than 3g cellular coverage. (3.5g) (3) You get T-mobile and AT&T coverage. (4) You get Android 5.0. (Full App play Store) (5) Small, slim and light weight for a 7"" phone device. (6) Budget quality phone. (7) Fast and smooth for regular use. (8) At a budget price. A great compromise device.Not a $600+ flagship phone. Not a $250+ mid-level phone. This is a great budget cellular connected 7"" tablet. OR Best 7"" screen budget phone.I FOUND A CASE THAT FITS PERFECTLY (near perfectly)Belkin Tri-Fold Case and Cover for Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7'', Black (F7P321B1C00)http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Tri-Fold-Samsung-Galaxy-F7P321B1C00/dp/B00ZNM2TAE/This case makes this budget phone look and feel premium. It really does. And it comes in 9 different colors, too.Hey BLU Company. You owe me a big one. (I found a high class case for case-less phone)This case fits the Blu Studio 7.0 II like a glove. Looks custom made for BLU 7.0 IIAll button and ports a free except for the back camera hole. BLU should contact Belkin and get the rear camera hole lined up. Then it would be a perfect match.I found the Belkin case in a physical bsbuy electronics store. Its costs $39. I googled the case part number F7P321B1C00 and was able to get a pricematch for $19.99.Kmarz on sale for $19.99. Some colors of this case are selling for $30 on amazon. They might pricematch. But $30 is better than $39.I physically compared the Studio 7.0 II to many tablets. The Galaxy Tab 4 Tablet is almost identical in size. The Blu 7.0 II Tablet. Is about one inch longer.Galaxy Tab 4 Tablet is 7.4"" and Blu 7.0 II is 7.5"" long.The Blu 7.0 II Tablet would not fit any Tab 4 case with a hard molded shell. The BLU is 1"" too long. So the only cases that fit are the 7"" tablet cases with the adjustable corners. The generic 7"" cases with the rubber band like corners worked too. They don't fit as well as the Belkin. However, they are better stands than the Belkin. The generic 7"" cases can be had for a little as $5 or below on the internet and amazon. I searched for Universal 7"" Tablet Case.The Belkin case has 4 adjustable corners. The power, 3.5 mm jack, volume buttons, front speaker and camera are all clear and usable with the Belkin case. The rear camera hole is blocked. The belkin is not a good stand. It falls over easily. The generic 7"" tablet case with the 4 rubber band like corner make the best stand for the blu 7.0 II. Try to avoid the 7"" and 8"" combo cases. The generic 7"" case looks better. But the Belkin case looks custom made and high quality. The generic 7"" cases can be had for a little as $5 or below on the internet and amazon. I searched for Universal 7"" Tablet Case.The physical store only had the black color Belkin case and I got the last one. Here on amazon, they have many colors. At different prices each. Each color at different price.HEY BLU COMPANY YOU OWE ME A BIG ONE for taking three days to physically walk around many stores to find a near perfect case for your phone. A couple freebies would be appreciated. Also, contact Belkin to get the back camera hole aligned. I'm serious.http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Tri-Fold-Samsung-Galaxy-F7P321B1C00/dp/B00ZNM2TAE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZNM2TAE",5,1

Since receiving the phone back a month ago, I have stopped saving apps on the SD card, only saving photos on it in the hopes that it would prevent the corruption problem. Unfortunately, and perhaps predictably, it has begun corrupting MicroSD cards AGAIN, causing me to lose all my photos on my phone, once again.I cannot emphasize this enough - DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.*Original Review*I bought this to replace my beloved Galaxy S3, which had served me for three years without major problems, but was getting a little slow thanks to larger, more demanding apps.

In the 10 months I have had it, the phone has corrupted FIVE micro SD cards of various sizes and manufacturers, and has required factory resetting twice just to get the phone to function.With the majority of the in-built storage taken up by Verizon bloatware, this leaves scant space for apps, which really requires a large SD card. However, when the phone is constantly burning up your SD cards (rendering them unrecoverable and completely unrecognized when plugged into computers), there's really no point in having this over the S3.Currently, the phone is awaiting a warranty call from Samsung because it has fried yet another micro SD card, and claims that many apps that are installed are not installed on the phone. It's also corrupted the majority of the photos that I've taken and stored to the SD card. Thank goodness for Dropbox cloud backups!Ultimately, don't buy this phone. You may get one that works, or you may get a giant headache that could be solved by either spending more and buying a new one, or buying a better phone.",1,1

396354,Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems.",1,7
28963,Apple iPhone 5c 32GB - Unlocked - (White),Apple,"**1 Month Update (6/16/16):Still running great with excellent battery life. My only grief is the storage capacity of 8GB, which I was fully aware of going into the purchase. Great phone for the price, and in my case, the perfect temp for until the iPhone 7 comes out. Even in 2016, I'd recommend the 5C over the 5 & 5S just based on price point, and the assumption that this Fall the iPhone 7 will be amongst the heroes. No point in my opinion of spending > 200$ for a new iPhone of any model until this year's releases.So if you need an iPhone immediately, 5c is the way to go. Bare with it until its big brother comes out. It won't let you down.**Note on seller, seems trustworthy since the apple care was never registered and began once I synced the iPhone to itunes for the first time.Initial Product Review:I bought this via Amazon prime fulfilled by seller ""Breed"" a couple of days ago. TBH, I was really hesitant about purchasing such an old iPhone model in ""New"" condition, however to the best of my knowledge, the iPhone came exactly as described. The only strange thing was the fact that there was already a Verizon sim card inserted in the sim slot. The phone was described as not Verizon compatible however I'm thinking it was originally meant to just be a Verizon phone a retail location was unable to sell. The phone does function correctly with T-Mobile and is assuringly running on GSM not CDMA. SO what are my overall thoughts thus far?1. The phone did come in new condition.2. The phone does work on GSM networks, and possibly on Verizon as well.3. I paid just under 180$ for the phone, and it is confirmed to be unlocked with a 1 year apple care warranty, so seriously... what more could I ask for?As far as a review of the product relating to Apple.1. The battery, it's an older model and has probably been sitting in a storefront for at least 2 years... meaning it holds a charge, just not as good as it did 2 years ago most likely. Still, definitely lasts through a days worth of use.2. 8GB is really only enough storage if you're like me and spend most of your time in front of a computer, meaning you only really need your phone for email, messaging, status updates, gps etc. It's fine for me, but then again, I have like two pictures, 0 songs, and pretty much stream anything and everything.3. It's an Apple product. You can't go wrong with apple, even if the device itself goes wrong. They'll sort you out.**Should anything change I'll be sure to update this review, but as of 5/20/16, I'm one happy customer Amazon :)",5,4

Trying to get one for my wife who had a bad experience (still is) with an International version of the S4. The T-Mobile visual voice mail is a nice feature that apparently comes standard with Apple devices, but I'd much rather have this phone than any of the iPhones........enjoyI've had the phone 4 days and other than it initially hemming up new download applications while it was attempting to load a ton of previously installed google play applications from my old phone (definitely recommend stopping all downloads and manually download and/or update only a couple at a time), it's running great!!! I was worried initially because while it was downloading a ton of apps, when I would move my fingers toward the top of the screen it would start to glitch, but have not had that issue since - of note, an S4 I purchased seems to have the issue where you move your hand anywhere near the top of the screen and it shuts down the screen - think it might be a hardware issue, but could be a software issue related to shutting the screen off when making phone calls that is doing the same thing in other applications.....Any rate, this phone came in new packaging, looks and feels brand new, and has some really great features compared to my old S3. The phone's operating system takes up about 4 Gigs, which appears to be standard, but it did some really helpful things automatically like changing my phone storage and picture storage preferences to my micro SD card and asking if I wanted to keep that setting. Battery charges fully in 1-2 hours depending on how low you drain it. I typically will charge once it gets to 10-20%, but even when it was down to 5-7% it charged in no more than 2 hours. Plugging the charger into the phone in the dark is a task, but I'm hoping the wireless charging kit I bought will alleviate that issue.I only gave this 4 stars because it's way too early to give it 5 stars. If all is well after a month or two, it will be well deserving of 5 stars.",5,17
344807,Samsung Galaxy S4 SCH-I545 16GB Arctic Blue - Verizon Wireless,,"*** UPDATED TO 1 STAR FOR LACK OF WARRANTY SUPPORT ***The display on this phone died yesterday completely out of the blue as it sat on a desk. Having purchased it new just 7 months ago, I wasn't pressed as it should be under warranty, from Samsung's Warranty Declaration:""STANDARD LIMITED WARRANTY What is covered and for how long? The warranty period commences upon the date of purchase by the first consumer purchaser and continuing for the following specified period of time after that date: Device 1 YearBattery(ies)* 1 YearOther Accessories* 1 Year""Great, I can tick all those boxes. But after going through the repair request process, I was getting charged anyway. I contacted support directly, and was told by rep Janet my phone was out of warranty ""on their end"". To make things worse, you can't reply, but have to start from the beginning and make a brand new support request for another random rep. And none of their survey or feedback links work.Typical of so many companies. Great product, worthless support. A phone that costs hundreds of dollars should last more than a year - and if not, it should be fixed, period.Original Review:There are many incredibly in-depth reviews for this phone as it has been around awhile. I couldn't see any reason to pay more money to get the newer version - this one has everything I wanted in a phone. The only knock I would give it is battery life. Coming from the Motorola line of 'Maxx' phones (which last for a minimum of 2 days on a charge), it was a bit of a transition. But generally, it does get through a day of my typical use. (just barely).Newer Samsung devices are Qi wireless charging compatible. This one is not - BUT you can easily add it with one of these:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HR10NZW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1The S4 has the contacts (just above the battery compartment). This means installation takes no more then popping off the battery cover, slipping in the Qi adapter and aligning it with the charge contacts, and replacing the cover. 10 seconds, done. Now you have wireless charging!I can only knock this phone for two things, the battery life (though it does charge VERY quickly), and of course all the bloatware that comes installed. Thankfully you can remove or turn off all this easily - which will also help your battery life.",1,9

The phone was in Japanese upon startup and the phone had already 2 text messages (dated 26 Aug) from YMobile suggesting someone must have got it free from them and sold it off onto amazon resellers.

394002,"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,"(See updates below)First off, I'm not into cell phones and gadgets. My previous phone was a Google Nexus S, which lasted me 4 years. If you're looking for a review of the phone compared to other recent models, you might skip this.I picked this phone because of the size, battery life and apparently the top of the line specs it provides. While I do not care much about features and specs I do plan to keep the phone for a while and having top notch specs today ensures that it won't be completely outdated in a few years.*Form Factor and Build*The size of this phone is very nice compared to the giant slabs you get nowadays. It is slightly bigger than my old Nexus and any bigger would probably become annoying to hold. The build seems pretty solid. Sony claims the phone is waterproof. This results in the charge port and other ports being covered by a rubber plug. I can't help but think that constantly taking the plug on and off to charge is going to wear it pretty quickly.The phone is extremely slippery. This is one of the truly pointless things I see manufacturers do nowadays. There is really no point in making a device that can slide down a book placed on a table, just to keep up with the equally stupid competition and to make stupid consumers feel good about a smooth glassy phone. Bottom line: get a cover.* Battery Life*This is truly impressive. I've only had the phone for a week, so I do not know how long it will hold up, but I've run the phone on one charge for 4 days of moderate use (several phone calls, moderate texting, reading news over lunch, music in the gym). LTE and Wifi enabled. At the end of those 4 days I still had like 25% battery left.*Screen, Camera, Features *I'm not going to say much here because I really don't have a good baseline. The screen looks really crisp and nice. The whole thing is pretty fast. The camera looks good too, although 20 megapixel is of course yet another pile of horse crap Sony sells to dumb consumers. The gestures feature is pretty nice. I can pick up the phone by just putting it to my ear (no need to touch the screen). Really nice when driving, so that I don't have to take my driving gloves off.* Software *I bought the international version of this phone. I was hoping for something that comes with minimum bloatware, certainly without any telecom provider bloatware. Unfortunately the phone I got was apparently packaged for the German T-Mobile and there was all kinds of software from them. Additionally there is Amazon software (never asked for that either) and bloatware from Sony itself. I've found out that the Sony stuff will try to show you ads for their movies and whatnot. For example the Gallery app (which is called Album and tries to sell you Sony's cloud photo album solution) will have an ad at the end of the pictures.I was able to get rid of most of this crap, however all of this is extremely annoying. If I'm paying full, unsubsidized price for a phone I at least can expect the manufacturer to refrain from shoving its crappy ads in my face.All in all though, this is a pretty good offering and the size and battery life really make it worth for me.**** Update: ****So after using the phone for a while I noticed some things I definitely don't like. The call quality is actually mediocre at best. The swype style keyboard that comes with the phone appears to be different from the standard one in the Android stack and is far inferior to the latter.There is a far bigger issue however. Yesterday I dropped the phone from what was probably 2 feet. The screen cracked in the corner, which itself wasn't the big issue, however the touchscreen now only works on something like 30% of the screen. The top half of the screen won't work and the bottom half is mostly misaligned. The phone as such is hardly usable. Obviously Sony refused to replace it under warranty.Now I understand that when things fall they might break, however this was by far not a harsh fall. All of my previous smartphones have taken *a lot* of beating. My Nexus S got kicked down a stairwell, fell from an industrial vehicle and nothing. This is an utter joke of build quality from Sony and needless to say I will be looking at something else.",1,11

206356,"JUNING Unlocked Dual Sim 3G GSM Smartphone, MTK6580 Quad Core ROM 4GB 5 MP Camera (Pink)",," This phone is fantastic! I've been getting more and more dissatisfied with the Samsung Galaxy phones that come out each generation because they're filled with so much more bloatware that can't be removed. I loved that this Android OS is completely custom and not filled with advertisements for Samsung.I still like the high end hardware that the new phone's come with though, so buying this phone was the perfect compromise. This phone came with a case, a charger, an instruction manual and brand new ear buds.The 5.0"" qHD Display, is big, solid and bright in my hand. The RAM and ROM are pretty reasonable. You get 4GB of ROM to start with and each app you add, plus the OS will subtract from that. You can add storage to the phone though if that's not enough for you. Ram is 512 MB, this is fine for most users. Ram determines how fast your phone can open and remember apps. I like to think of RAM and ROM like a car. ROM is how much can fit in it. RAM is how fast the car can go. Both numbers are perfectly fine for this phone, I didn't feel like it was a downgrade from other phones on the market. The dual camera is great. The back is 5MP, and takes crystal clear photos. Front is 0.3 mp, which is just fine for selfies. The phone runs on 3g not 4g, but I only use wifi to cut down on data costs so that wasn't an issue for me.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I would recommend this phone as a first cell phone for someone. It's a bit behind the market in terms of storage and speed, but it costs roughly a tenth of other unlocked smartphones. I think that's a fantastic trade-off! Give the phone a try, it's really nice to have a worry-free smart phone.",5,6

It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly.

396376,Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony, There is a lot to like about the phone but there are a variety of issues too:1. Most importantly: this phone has a problem with touchscreen sensitivity in the lower part of the screen when the phone is not held in hand. It is particularly bad on some surfaces such as on a bed. Also the problem gets much worse if you install a glass protective screen. It starts being very noticeable on almost all surfaces.I've made a quick demonstration video about the issue (see below). Other users have reported this issue with their phone https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/z5-compact-touchscreen-acting-weird/m-p/1079627/highlight/false#M6713Therefore it is a design defect by Sony. Surprisingly it appears to affect only the white version of the phone.2. It does heat up quite a lot during normal use (like updating apps) or watching videos. And the battery is drained faster than on previous version that I have (Z1 Compact)3. I didn't see any improvement in photo quality compared to the old Z1 (in fact some pics look worse in identical settings).

(Model#: L520 GOLD)",Posh Mobile," The Posh Mobile Kick Pro LTE L520 is virtually the same size as my Samsung Galaxy S7. Its CPU and graphics processing aren't as fast as the S7, and the screen resolution is lower, but as a practical matter, in many ways, it's comparable to the S7, which costs several times as much.After charging the removable 2000mAh battery with the included AC adapter (5V/1.0A), I connected with my home wi-fi, went through the setup, and installed a few apps that I use to check out a new phone or tablet. The phone comes with about two dozen preinstalled apps. The next thing I did was insert a prepaid micro-SIM (15mm x 12mm) in one of the two SIM slots. Phone reception and texting were excellent over the T-Mobile system. I did not have a data plan, however, so I was unable to test the GPS over a roaming 4G connection.I also inserted a 32 GB micro-SD card in the provided slot. I then went to the settings and made the SD card the default write disk. Right out of the box, the phone had a little over 4 GB of available memory. This would be enough for many people, but adding the SD card greatly increases the capacity for storing apps, books, music, and video.The phone came with Android 6.0 (""Marshmallow"") installed. One of the things I really like about Android is that when I signed into my Google account, my phone contacts and Chrome bookmarks synced and were available almost immediately. The phone uses most of the Android conventions, such as the power/volume down buttons to take a screenshot.The screen display is 1280x720 (320 dpi). That's the same resolution as my old Moto X, and it had an excellent display. I watched some sports and a few videos, and the images had good contrast with rich, saturated colors. The viewing angle was not critical - in both portrait and landscape orientation, I could move to either side and the image was still good. Although the newer high-end smartphones have higher resolution, the Kick Pro LTE L520 has a very good IPS display that looks great. Playing videos on it, I honestly couldn't see any difference from the 2560x1440 resolution of my Galaxy S7.With a 2000mAh battery powering the operating system, background services, and the 5"" (diagonal) display, I didn't expect great battery life, but I was pleasantly surprised. I tested the battery by streaming full-screen video with audio, and the battery lasted for 4:40. For typical mixed use of phone calls, web browsing, reading, music, and apps, the battery will likely last much longer than that. Afterward, I recharged the battery using the Posh AC adapter.The audio from the twin speakers on the back of the phone isn't high fidelity, but it's not bad either. The maximum volume is pretty loud, but as with most phones and small tablets that I've used, you may want to have an auxiliary speaker handy if the ambient noise is high. A set of decent earphones is included with the phone.The phone has Bluetooth connectivity. The phone paired easily and worked well with one of my Bluetooth speakers and with a Bluetooth keyboard. For non-Bluetooth speakers and headphones, the phone has a 3.5mm audio jack.The phone has front and rear cameras. The rear camera is 8.3 MP (3840x2160). The front camera is 5.3 MP (3072x1728). Both cameras can shoot video as well as still photos. Video is 640x480 at 24 fps in MPEG-4 format. The camera has the typical Android camera controls, including autofocus, face detection, and 4X manual zoom. I was very pleased with the quality of the images. The detail the camera captures is very good, and it will focus very close (approximately 5-6 inches) without using an auxiliary lens.I used the AnTuTu Benchmark app to see how the phone compared to other Android phones, and it scored 24,284. That's almost as high as my Moto X's score of 27,898, and the Moto X (2013 model) was a highly rated phone just a couple of years ago.The phone comes as part of a complete package which includes an AC power adapter and USB charging cable, a set of earphones with microphone for hands-free calling, a screen protector, and a silicone ""jelly"" case that gives a good gripping surface and provides a moderate amount of protection for the phone. My only complaint is with the mice type of the user guide - I needed a magnifying glass to read it. It doesn't matter much, however, since the guide isn't really needed by anyone who's ever owned an Android device.A couple of random comments:* The phone does not have NFC (Near Field Communication).* The phone does not support wireless charging.The bottom line: I like the phone. It's fast enough for most purposes, it has a superb 5-inch display, its cameras are very good, and the battery life is good. It's one of the best sub-$100 unlocked Android phones that I've used.The phone was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.",5,4
309807,"Samsung Galaxy G920F-S6 32GB Factory Unlocked 5.1"" - International Sourced Version - Black",Samsung," I've been testing this out for work and the S6 is a brilliant mobile.It's easy (if long winded if you opt to use the fingerprint scanner) to setup, and once connected to WiFi it updated to Android 6.0.1.If you do take the the time to setup the fingerprint scanner you’ll benefit from fast unlocking without the need to enter a pin or screen code, just pickup the phone, pop your thumb on the sensor and it unlocks.Unlike the previous plastic S5 the S6 feels like a premium handset with a lovely design. The only thing that might bug you is the camera around the back, which sticks out a little bit from the back of the body.Interestingly next to the rear camera is not only a flash, but a small health sensor for measuring things like your heart rate.Samsung have kept the S6 relatively bloatware free, things like the health sensor make use of the included S Health app and the apps pre installed all seem like they might be useful.Unfortunately there isn’t the option to add a microSD card, however this is somewhat mitigated by being given 100GB of OneDrive storage space free for 2 years.The camera on this is brilliant, shots are lovely and clear, the autofocusing works well, you can pull focus to certain spots, good depth of field, you really won’t need a dedicated camera if you have this in your pocket!The S6 also impresses when playing games. The screen looks gorgeous and it’s big enough to allow the use of onscreen controls without your hands getting in the way of the action.Worth noting the speakers are located on the bottom of the handset so if you are a gamer that plays a lot of landscape games you might find your hand covering the speaker and muffling the sound a little.It might not be the newest Samsung phone, but it still has a lot to offer, it’s easy to see why Samsung are doing so well in mobiles.",5,2
