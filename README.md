# RateMyPhone
Classifying the user review to one of the rating class. User will enter the reviews as the plain text in the input box and end result will be the rating based on the classifying model used.

# Summary
- This is my final project for the Data Mining course at UTA. In this project I have to implement 3 phases
- Search : Here user can search for the mobile phones based on the free form search query. User can search for any query, if any similar data is found in the dataset then it will be showed as result.
- Classifier : In this phase user's review will be classified as one of the rating class. Here user give the review of the phone as the free form text and classifier will be able to classify the rating based on the review.
- Image Captioning : This phase is not related to the project but this option will let user to generate the captions for the uploaded images.
- I will use two different datasets. one for search and classifier and another for captioning.
